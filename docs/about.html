It wasoriginally intended to be of limited interest, a simplerversion to serve as a programmers introduction to vMac.But vMac hasn&rsquo;t been updated in many years, soMini vMac may now be considered its continuation. </p><p> The &ldquo;Mini&rdquo; in the name now means thateach emulator in the collection is as small and simpleas possible. The meta program and data thatgenerate the emulators (the Mini vMac<a href="build.html">build system</a>)are rather bigger. Besides the Macintosh Plus, thereare also emulations of the Macintosh 128K, 512K, 512Ke,SE, Classic, and SE FDHD.Work is in progress on Macintosh II emulation.There are also numerous other<a href="options.html">options</a>.</p><p> Mini vMac requires a ROM image file to run, and so canbe legally used only by those who own a 680x0 based Macintosh.This leads to the question,if you need to own the real computer to use it, whatis the use of the emulator? First, a real Macintoshwon&rsquo;t last forever. It is common for the power supply tofail. It is still legal to use the emulation after the realcomputer breaks. And second, the emulation is moreconvenient than the real thing. It is much faster (onmodern computers) and you can use a better screen, keyboard,and mouse. And it is easier to transfer files between themodern computer and the emulator. </p><p> Mini vMac is part of the<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">Gryphel Project</a>,about helping to preserve software made for early Macintosh computers.Another component of the Gryphel Project is a list of<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/alt/index.html">Alternatives to Mini vMac</a>.</p><p> : </p><p> If you find Mini vMac useful, please consider<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</A>.</p><a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html"><img src="https://www.gryphel.com/d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p> Next - <b><a href="screens/index.html">Screenshots</a></b></p><p> Or skip to - <b><a href="download.html">Download Mini vMac</a></b> </p><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/about- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2011 Paul C.
