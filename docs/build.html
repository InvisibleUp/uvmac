Compiling with other development environments may encountercompiler bugs and Mini vMac bugs that only some compilers trigger. I tryensure that Mini vMac can compile with other development environments atthe time of final release of a branch, but the results are not testedtoo thoroughly. Further, new versions of development environmentsreleased later may cause further problems, which won&rsquo;t becorrected before the next branch of Mini vMac. So, when you compileyour own copy of Mini vMac, you will need to test it thoroughly,and find a fix for any problems yourself. Second, for alldevelopment environments besides the set of GCC cross compilers thatI use, the build system just tries to configure it for maximum chance ofworking correctly, and not for performance. If you want goodperformance, you will need to try out various compiler options, seewhat is fastest, and then thoroughly test to make sure that itworks correctly. Third, if you are not familiar with your chosendevelopment environment, I can not teach everyone in that position. Forlack of time, and that I&rsquo;m no expert in all developmentenvironments either.</p><p>:</p><p>First download the source code archive from the<a href="download.html">download</a>page, a file with the name like&ldquo;minivmac-3x.xx.src.tgz&rdquo;.Extract from this file to get a folder.(Whose contents are described in the<a href="contents.html">Contents of the source distribution</a> page.)</p><p>The source for the configurationtool is in &ldquo;setup&rdquo;folder. In a unix like system,such as Linux on x86-64,it can be compiled using something like&ldquo;gcc setup/tool.c -o setup_t&rdquo;, then run with somethinglike &ldquo;./setup_t -t lx64 > setup.sh&rdquo;, and the outputrun with &ldquo;. setup.sh&rdquo;, and then Mini vMac can becompiled with &ldquo;make&rdquo;.</p><p>Besides &ldquo;-t&rdquo;, the configuration toolaccepts many more options, listed onthe <a href="options.html">Mini vMac Options</a> page.The <a href="develop.html">Develop</a> page hasmore options useful to developers and maintainers.</p><p>Before compiling the configuration tool, youcan insert definitions into &ldquo;setup/CONFIGUR.i&rdquo;,such as to specify what development environment youare using. The <a href="setupcfg.html">Setup Tool Configuration</a>page lists such choices.</p><p> : </p><p> If you find Mini vMac useful, please consider<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</A>.</p><a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html"><img src="https://www.gryphel.com/d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p> Next - <b><a href="appc/index.html">Compiling Build System</a></b> </p><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/build- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2016 Paul C.
