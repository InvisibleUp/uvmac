In OS X itchecks in "/Users/[your_UserName]/Library/Preferences/Gryphel/mnvm_rom/".In Windows XP, "C:\Documents and Settings\[your_UserName]\Application Data\Gryphel\mnvm_rom\".Windows 98, "C:\WINDOWS\Application Data\Gryphel\mnvm_rom\". Andin Vista, I think "C:\Users\[your_UserName]\AppData\Roaming\Gryphel\mnvm_rom\".Usually "mnvm_rom" would be an alias (on OS X, on Windows this is called a short cut)to where ever you keep your ROM collection. This avoids having to create an alias to the ROM imagefor each emulated Mac you use. </p><p> <a name="modified"> <b> Changed behavior in default compile </b> </a> </p><p> * The alternate CPU emulation of Mini vMac 3.0.4 is now the main and only emulation.(The &ldquo;-alt-cpu&rdquo; build option is gone.) This makes Mini vMac slightlyfaster, and allows more accurate detection of illegal instructions withoutspeed penalty. It also reduces the amount of code to be optimized inassembly language (Currently only done for PowerPC).The PowerPC assembly code version has been revised to match the new emulation,and is now used for the PowerPC Linux version. </p><p> * More accurate mouse and keyboard event handling, by using an eventqueue to communicate between the platform dependent code and the platformindependent code. Previously, the platform dependent code would tellthe platform independent code every emulated sixtieth of a second thecurrent mouse position and up/down state of the mouse button and keys.If the host computer was very busy, or just slow, then a down and uppair could end up being processed in the same emulated sixtieth, andthey would cancel each other out and be lost entirely. Also a mousebutton state change might not be processed until well after it happened,and the mouse position might be different by then.(Though if Mini vMac is not getting time every sixtieth of a second,so that these problems can be observed, then sound emulation isn'tlikely to work either, emitting horrible noises. But it is possibleto compile Mini vMac without sound. And also if the host computeris a device without a keyboard, such as using handwriting recognition,then there might not be separate key down and key up.) </p><p> * The Macintosh and Windows versions now match the X version innot initially filling the sound buffer with silence, butinstead waiting to accumulate real sound samples before startingto play sound. This may reduce the tendency to stutteras the program starts, mostly by giving the emulationmore time to get settled into a regular rhythm beforeattempting sound.I also changed the X version to match the Macintosh andWindows version in only skipping a single sound block onunderrun, rather than stop playing sound until thebuffer is refilled. </p><p> * Includes code sent by Jes&uacute;s A. &Aacute;lvarez ("zydeco") from his <a href="http://namedfork.net/iphone/minivmac">iPhone/iPod Touch port</a>that improves support for the Disk Copy 4.2 disk image format,using information found in the<a href="http://lisa.sunder.net/">Lisa Emulator Project</a>by Ray A. Arachelian. Mini vMac will now get the correct sizeof the data in a Disk Copy 4.2 disk image,and will identify such an image even if it is not inHFS or MFS format. </p><p> * When Mini vMac is in full screen mode, it triesto send all key events to the emulated computer,instead of any normal meanings they would havein the host operating system. But I've decidedthat it went too far with this. So now in OS X,in full screen mode, it will no longer disableforce quit (command-option-escape). This wasjust too dangerous, especially during developmentof Mini vMac. You can still send command-option-escapeto the emulated computer, using the F1 and F2 keys,which are mapped to 'option' and 'command'. </p><p> * The X version now uses mouse motion events when possible insteadof XQueryPointer, which is alleged to be inefficient. (Especially ifthe program is using the display on another computer, so that XQueryPointerrequires a round trip over the network. I've never tried this.I don't know if anyone has.) </p><p> * Thanks to a tip from William Nolan, Mini vMac nowhas, when accessing the emulated computer's memory,a special case for little endian processorsthat allow unaligned access (such Intel), similarto the existing special case for big endian (such as PowerPC).This makes it a bit faster. </p><p> * I've made a number of small changesto the replacement disk driver that I think makeit act closer to original Apple versions. (But whichdon't make any known observable difference.) </p><p> <a name="bugs"> <b> Bug fixes in default compile </b> </a> </p><p> * None Yet. </p><p> <a name="compile_feature"> <b> New features not in default compile </b> </a> </p><p> * Support for the new<a href="../var/mnvm0159.html">Mini vMac Variations</a>service.<p> * You can choose the emulated screen size(&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_xres">-hres and -vres</a>&rdquo;). </p><p> * There is an initial port to GTK+. However, this portisn't complete yet. It will allow the Linuxversion to better match the other ports, with menusand an open file dialog. It also will make possiblea port to Maemo, which is based on Gtk. The build option is&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_t">-t lx86</a><a href="../options.html#option_api">-api gtk</a>&rdquo;.(The build system now optionallyallows you to choose what API to use, instead of automaticallysetting it from the selected target.) </p><p> * Can now use a Macintosh Classic ROM, thanks to assistance from<a href="http://www.mac128.com/">David Sibley</a> and "Gord".The build option is<a href="../options.html#option_m">-m Classic</a>&rdquo;.Though it runs, it is not necessarily an accurate emulation of aMac Classic. A Mac Classic is supposed to be nearly identicalto a Mac SE, but there are a few minor differences. Theremay be more differences that I don't know about. I can'treally work on this much further until I own a MacClassic.Getting the Mac Classic emulation to work to this extent involvedfixing some issues in the emulation of the VIA chip. </p><p> One thing to be aware of is that the Mac Classic ROM should be512K. Apparently some ROM acquisition programs only save thefirst 256K. The<a href="../extras/copyroms/index.html">CopyRoms</a>program should save the correct size. </p><p> * Can now use a Macintosh SE FDHD ROM, thanks to assistance fromSteve Secker and <a href="http://www.mac128.com/">David Sibley</a>.The build option is<a href="../options.html#option_m">-m SEFDHD</a>&rdquo;.It is currently identical to the Macintosh SEemulation, except for expecting a different ROM (which shouldbe named 'SEFDHD.ROM'). </p><p> * Have begun emulation of the Macintosh II.The build option is<a href="../options.html#option_m">-m II</a>&rdquo;.It doesn't yet emulate the FPU or ASC, but somesoftware will still run. Since a Macintosh IIcan be hard to find there is also a buildoption <a href="../options.html#option_m">-m IIx</a>&rdquo;which accepts the ROM from a IIx, but otherwisecurrently is identical to the Mac II emulation.The Macintosh IIcx, the Macintosh II FDHD,and the Macintosh SE/30 all have the same ROM as theMacintosh IIx. </p><p> * You can choose the emulated screen color depth(&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_depth">-depth</a>&rdquo;)in the Macintosh II emulation. </p><p> * With the build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_sony_sum">-sony-sum 1</a>&rdquo;,Mini vMac will update the checksum in a Disk Copy 4.2 disk imagewhen it is unmounted. This prevents other programs that deal withsuch images from complaining about an invalid checksum.(I didn't include this by default, because it makes Mini vMacslightly bigger and slower.) </p><p> * With the build system option &ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_sony_tag">-sony-tag 1</a>&rdquo;,Mini vMac tries to support file tags. There are an additional 12 bytesfor each 512 byte block on a 400K or 800K floppy disk, containingsome additional information that was supposed to aid inrecovering damaged disks, but was never actually used much.The Disk Copy 4.2 disk image format can support these tags.(The more usual raw format, such as found in<a href="../extras/blanks/index.html">Blanks</a>, does not.) </p><p> * The build system option &ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_sony_dc42">-sony-dc42 0</a>&rdquo;completely disables support for disk images in disk copy 4.2format. This could be useful when trying to compile thesmallest and simplest version of Mini vMac possible forsome specific purpose. It should not be used when compilinga version of Mini vMac for general distribution, becausea primary goal of Mini vMac is that disk images thatwork with any past version of the program should alsowork with the current and any future version (at leastwhen default compile options are used). </p><p> * There is now a build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_vsync">-vsync 1</a>&rdquo;for OS X only, which turns on OpenGL double bufferingand sets AGL_SWAP_INTERVAL to 1. This eliminates the"tearing" issues noted Manuel Alfayate. Unfortunatelyit isn't yet a real solution. Beside using much morememory, it also reduces the maximum speed of emulationunpredictably and erratically, because it makesaglSwapBuffers block until the vertical retrace,when Mini vMac is expecting to give the emulationextra time, for above "1x" speed. Anyway it helpsto illustrate the issue. Now that I've seen whatit looks like with vsync, I can see the differencein certain games. </p><p> <a name="compile_modified"> <b> Changed behavior not in default compile </b> </a> </p><p> * There are some refinements to the&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_akm">Alternate Keyboard Mode</a>&rdquo;.Typing ';' now locks the mode on, there is no temporarystate. (I found holding ';' while typing other keys toomuch strain.) Typing 'm' now leaves the mode. (I find'm' slightly easier to hit than 'u', and it is nolonger needed for entering the mode.) The 'shift' and'option' keys now override the mode like the 'command'key does. (So anything except lowercase letters can betyped without leaving the mode.) When compiled with theAlternate Keyboard Mode, Mini vMac now starts up with themode on rather than off. (I think I've reinvented whatI've read about the vi editor. You are normally incommand mode, and only use insert mode temporarily.)A number of the mappings are changed: 'a' - semicolon,'b' - backslash, 'e' - backspace, 'h' - equal, 'n' - minus,'o' - ], 'r' - return, 't' - tab, 'u' - [, and 'p' and 'w'are now not used. </p><p> * The&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_akm">Alternate Keyboard Mode</a>&rdquo;option now gives a visualindication of the current keyboard mode, intendedto be easy to see in peripheral vision, without coveringup where text is normally typed. </p><p> * The Macintosh SE emulation, in full screen mode, will now emulatethe ADB protocol for mouse movement, instead of just poking the changesinto emulated low memory. This turned up a bug where apparently emulatedADB devices were responding to commands too quickly, before the emulatedMac was ready. I increased the constant that specifies the delay. </p><p> <a name="compile_bugs"> <b> Bug fixes not in default compile </b> </a> </p><p> * Two bug fixes in the<a href="../options.html#option_em_cpu">68020</a>emulation, in distinguishing between long DIV and MUL,and in bit field operations with width of 32. </p><p> <a name="build"> <b> Build System </b> </a> </p><p> * The build systemnow has a separate argument for the memory size ofthe emulated machine(&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_mem">-mem</a>&rdquo;),instead of includingthis in the model(&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_m">-m</a>&rdquo;). </p><p> * The build system now supports Xcode 3.1, using the option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_ev">-ev 3100</a>&rdquo;.Mini vMac compiles without warnings,which wasn't possible with the SDK that comeswith Xcode 2.4.1. </p><p> * The build system now supportsMicrosoft Visual Studio 2008 Express, using&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_t">-t wx86</a><a href="../options.html#option_ev">-ev 9000</a>&rdquo;.<p> * The build system supports compiling the Pocket PC versionwith Microsoft Embedded Visual C++ 4 for ARM and the emulator(&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_t">-t wcar</a>&rdquo; and&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_t">-t wc86</a>&rdquo;).</p><p> * The build system supports using the command line tools of the LCC compiler(&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_e">-e lcc</a><a href="../options.html#option_cl">-cl</a>&rdquo;). </p><p> * The build system supports the Sun c compiler(&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_e">-e snc</a>&rdquo;). </p><p> * The build system now has an&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_an">-an</a>&rdquo;option, for changingthe programs abbreviated name, from the default "minivmac".So the Mini vMac variations are compiled with say "-an mnvm0001",instead of "-n mnvm0001-3.1.0-umch". The abbreviatedname must be 8 characters or less, and should only includelowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. </p><p> * The build system will now check if the folder"System Folder:Preferences:Gryphel:Build:output" exists,and if so direct output there, instead of"minivmac:output:". This is usefulif you keep the minivmac source disk image ona flash drive, avoiding excessive wear. </p><p> * The build system can now resolve aliases of folders, such as theoutput preference folder. So the output can be directed anywhere,such as to another disk. </p><p> * The build system can now handle multiple sets of optionsat once, separated by ";". I use this in the process ofcompiling the set of Mini vMac Variations. To allow thisto work, the build system no longer replaces the entire outputfolder on each run, but just replaces folders withinthe output folder. </p><p> * I've removed the "-pk" option of the build system torestrict the program to a more manageable scope. And anywayI find it more convenient to handle post processing in externalscripts. </p><p> : </p><p> If you find Mini vMac useful, please consider<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</A>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html"><img src="https://www.gryphel.com/d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p> Back up to - <b><a href="index.html">Changes in Mini vMac versions</a></b></p><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="index.html">change</a>/v3.1- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2009 Paul C.
