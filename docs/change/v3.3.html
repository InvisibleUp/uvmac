If using it as you would previouslywould behave differently, that is "changed behavior". --><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * More operating systems are officially supported by Mini vMac: </p><blockquote><p>  FreeBSD on x86-32 (Using &ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_t">-t fbsd</a>&rdquo; in the build system)<br> FreeBSD on x86-64 (&ldquo;-t fb64&rdquo;)<br> OpenBSD on x86-32 (&ldquo;-t obsd&rdquo;)<br> OpenBSD on x86-64 (&ldquo;-t ob64&rdquo;)<br> NetBSD on x86-32 (&ldquo;-t nbsd&rdquo;)<br> NetBSD on x86-64 (&ldquo;-t nb64&rdquo;)<br> Dragonfly BSD on x86-32 (&ldquo;-t dbsd&rdquo;)<br> Dragonfly BSD on x86-64 (&ldquo;-t db64&rdquo;)<br> OpenIndiana on x86-32 (&ldquo;-t oind&rdquo;)<br> OpenIndiana on x86-64 (&ldquo;-t oi64&rdquo;)<br> Linux on ARM (&ldquo;-t larm&rdquo;)<br> Linux on SPARC (&ldquo;-t lspr&rdquo;)<br> Minix 3.2 ("-t minx")</p></blockquote><p> These ports adapt the same X Window code as the Linux port,and should have the same functionality, except currently notsound for some. The x86-64 versions are currently slower, for lackof assembly language tweaking, and should not be usedif the x86-32 versions will work. </p><p> * The X versions can now play sound using theOpen Sound System (OSS) API. (Usually using compatible implementationson each operating system, rather than the official OSS itself.)Sound is now enabled by default on FreeBSD and NetBSD. Soundcompiles without problems(using &ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_sound">-sound 1</a>&rdquo;)on Dragonfly BSD and OpenIndiana,but I have not been able to test on these yet. Gettingsound on Dragonfly BSD seems to require some manualsetting up. OpenIndiana doesn't seem to produce anysound at all in VMware Fusion. Sound also compiles withoutproblems on OpenBSD, but it doesn't work - setting thedesired sample rate fails. Minix doesn't really seem tosupport sound yet. It is also possible to use theOSS API on Linux, using the new &ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_snd_api">-snd-api</a>&rdquo;build system option.</p><p> * The X versions now will try to look in the foldercontain the application for the ROM image, like theMacintosh and Windows version do.(And also for disk1.dsk and so on files.)If the applicationdirectory can not be determined, the current directory is usedas before. This is implemented for Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD,Dragonfly BSD, and OpenIndiana, but not OpenBSD and Minix.</p><p> * The X versions now have a new<a href="../control.html#command_line">command line</a> option&ldquo;-d [directory_path]&rdquo;, in which [directory_path] is usedinstead of the application directory when looking forthe ROM image, and disk1.dsk and so on files.</p><p> * The X versions now have a new<a href="../control.html#command_line">command line</a> option&ldquo;-n [app_name]&rdquo;, in which [app_name] is usedinstead of the application name for the title of theMini vMac window.</p><p> * The X versions now supports a central ROM folder like theMacintosh and Windows versions have. If&ldquo;~/.gryphel/mnvm_rom&rdquo; exists,Mini vMac will look there for the ROM image.If it isn't there, it will look in the application directory.(And the -r command line option will override both.) </p><p> <a name="modified"> <b> Changed behavior in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * Drawing the emulated screen to the real screen is moreefficient. When the color depth is 4 bits or less, ratherthan converting each pixel, there is a table with 256 entriesfor converting one byte at a time. It is also more carefulabout only converting pixels in the rectangle bounding thechanged area, rather than the entire screen.</p><p> * The Linux version dynamically loads the ALSA library to play sound,so that Mini vMac will still run, without sound, even if ALSA is notinstalled. (This technique was seen in SDL.)So by default the Linux version is now compiled with sound,matching the Mac and Windows versions. </p><p> * In the Linux version, when playing sound with ALSA,snd_pcm_delay is no longer called. The delay untila sample is played is not really relevant. WhatMini vMac needs to know is time to buffer underrun.So Mini vMac now looks at buffer size minus theavailable space in the buffer, which may be more useful,for the purpose of preventing buffer underrun whileminimizing latency.</p><p> * The X versions now use advisory locking to refuse to openfor writing a disk image that has been opened for writing by anothercopy of Mini vMac. Previously, the X versions of Mini vMac couldopen an already opened disk image, likely corrupting the image. IfMini vMac can only open a disk image read only, suchas because the user has locked the file, then theadvisory lock is not used, and multiple copies of Mini vMaccan use it. </p><p> * The X versions now try to use the application name toset the title of its window, like the Macintosh and Windowsversions have. (If the application name can not be determined,&ldquo;Mini vMac&rdquo; is used as before.) This is found at thesame time as the application directory, and is implementedfor the same operating systems.</p><p> * Command line arguments are now scanned beforelooking for disk1.dsk and so on files. This isnecessary for the new &ldquo;-d&rdquo; option towork, and has the side effect that if disk imagesare specified on the command line, they will beopened first. If there are images on the commandline, Mini vMac will now not bother to look fordisk1.dsk at all. </p><p> * The &ldquo;-l&rdquo; (or &ldquo;/l&rdquo; on Windows)command line option is removed. The&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_speed">-speed z</a>&rdquo;option to the build system should be used instead.The command line option was from beforethe build system existed, and the decision madeto favor build time options over run time options.</p><p> <a name="bugs"> <b> Bug fixes in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * The Windows version now maps the Enter key on the numeric keypadto the Macintosh Enter key. It can now distinguish that key fromthe Enter key on the main keyboard, which is mapped to the MacintoshReturn Key. There was previously no way to type the Macintosh Enter key.Thanks to &ldquo;Alex&rdquo; for pointing out this issue.</p><p> * In the Windows version, in Full Screen Mode, the checkfor whether a key down event is an autorepeated key isincorrect. So potentially keys could have been ignored whenthey shouldn't have been. I've removed the check, since it isn'tclear how to do so correctly (when using a "low level keyboardhook"). This doesn't affect Macintosh emulation, since there isan additional check for redundant events. It can affect theControl mode, such as when holding down Control-M.</p><p> * The Windows version now respondsto the WM_QUERYENDSESSION message, so that if you tryto shut down your computer with Mini vMac running(with mounted disk images), then Mini vMac will complainand stop the shut down. </p><p> * In the Linux version, using ALSA to play sound,snd_pcm_start was called before putting any soundsamples in the ALSA buffer. This could cause stutteringat the beginning, or according to one report, preventsound from working at all. Mini vMac now waitsuntil its private buffer is full, then transfers as much aswill fit into the ALSA buffer, and then starts sound playing.</p><p> * When the Linux version is compiled for ARM,it includes a check that the result ofsnd_pcm_avail_update looks reasonable, and ifnot calls snd_pcm_status_get_avail instead. Thisworks around what appears to be a bug in Raspbianfor the Raspberry Pi. </p><p> * The emulated clock was not properly initialized,and was only correct after the first &ldquo;second&rdquo; interrupt. </p><p> * If the emulated screen is too big to fit on the real screen(when autoscroll is available), if the area of the emulated screenthat has changed doesn't intersect the visible area of the emulatedscreen, then an invalid rectangle was used for drawing.I discovered this when trying out Vector Linux 7, which seems tohave some extra debugging checks. </p><p> * In unlikely circumstances, in Full Screen Mode, autoscrollmay not scroll to show the last row of pixels at the bottomor the last column of pixels on the right. </p><p> * If the host computer is not fast enough for Mini vMacto run at 1x speeds, then Mini vMac would not run smoothly,pausing for a few seconds periodically. The test for thissituation was incorrect, and a one byte counter would overflow.(Have such counters as small as possible makes it easierto detect bugs like this.)</p><p> * In X Window versions of Mini vMac, when using the Mini vMacextension to create a file on the host system,such as with <a href="../extras/exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>,a save dialog is not implemented. Previously the file would simply becreated in the application directory with the asked forname. This was not safe, at worst it allows a programrunning in Mini vMac to replace the Mini vMac application.So now files will instead be created in a foldernamed "output" in the directory containing the application.This folder will be created if it does not exist. </p><p> * In the Microsoft Windows version, if a path to a diskimage is passed to Mini vMac on the command line that islonger than is legal for a path, a buffer overflow results.</p><p> * The Windows CE version suffered bit rot. It now compilesand at least works on the Microsoft Device Emulator withWindows Mobile Version 5.0. I have no idea if it works onreal hardware. Does anyone care? (Windows Mobile wasdiscontinued and replaced by Windows Phone.)This port was starting to interfere with maintaining themain Windows version, and the choice was to remove itentirely or make it maintainable.</p><p> <a name="compile_feature"> <b> New features not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * The new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_lt">-lt</a>&rdquo;enables<a href="http://mfort.net/Mini_vMac_LT/Mini_vMac_LT.html">Mike Fort's</a>LocalTalk emulation. The are currently some limitations.It is only implemented for OS X. It requires running the command&ldquo;sudo chmod ugo+rw /dev/bpf*&rdquo; to allow Mini vMac (and everyone else)access to all network traffic. The &ldquo;-lt&rdquo; option also cause Mini vMacto run in the background by default, because Mini vMac can't be a properLocalTalk node if it isn't running. And you need to manually turn onAppleTalk in the chooser - I can set the PRAM flags to boot withAppleTalk already on, but it doesn't work properly.</p><p> * A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_lang">-lang pol</a>&rdquo;selects a Polish translation of the user interface byPrzemys&#322;aw Buczkowski.</p><p> * The X versions have initial support for color(for Mac II emulation). The X Version so far only supports 24 bit &ldquo;TrueColor&rdquo;,and has a few other limitations on format. I doubt that anything besides TrueColoris used on modern machines, and so probably won't support the other options.Other depths such as 15, 16, and 32 bits may be used, and so probably shouldbe supported, if I can find a way to test them.</p><p> * A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_magnify">-mf</a>&rdquo;allows changing magnification from the default 2.For example, &ldquo;-mf 3&rdquo; sets the magnification to 3.The option &ldquo;-mf 1&rdquo; disablesmagnification (removing the Control-M command). Themagnification factor must be an integer. </p><p> <a name="compile_modified"> <b> Changed behavior not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * The default color depth for Mac II emulation is&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_depth">-depth 3</a>&rdquo;instead of &ldquo;-depth 0&rdquo;. </p><p> * For Macintosh II emulation, AutoSlow is now disabled by default&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_speed">-as 0</a>&rdquo;.AutoSlow may need some further tuning to work well withMac II emulation. </p><p> * In the X versions, the results of fwrite and fread on disk imagesare now checked for errors, which stops compiler warnings in recent Ubuntu. </p><p> <a name="compile_bugs"> <b> Bug fixes not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * Fixed a bug in the DIVS.L instruction reported by&ldquo;AP&rdquo;.(A 68020 instruction used in Mac II emulation.)</p><p> * Fixed the BFFFO instruction, which was completelybroken, as reported by &ldquo;AP&rdquo;.(Another 68020 instruction used in Mac II emulation.) </p><p> * Bit field operations on a register now use rotaterather than shift. The selected bits can be non contiguous,as pointed out by &ldquo;AP&rdquo;,and confirmed by the documentation.(Bit operations fields were added in the 68020.) </p><p> * Bit field operations on memory now try to onlyoperate on as many bytes as needed. Previously italways operated on 5 bytes, which could have undesirableeffects if operating on a memory mapped device, aspointed out by &ldquo;AP&rdquo;. </p><p> * The &ldquo;MoveP.L &lt;ea&gt;, Dn&rdquo; instruction mixedup the order of shifting and masking, and so wascompletely broken, as reported by &ldquo;AP&rdquo;.</p><p> * The hack that allows extra large amounts of Video RAMin the Macintosh II emulationwasn't working properly because an array used for addressspace translation in the CPU emulation wasn't allocatedlarge enough. Now the build system chooses the allocationsize. (This problem was observed for 1024x768 with millionsof colors.) Further detail:Each NuBus card gets only 1M of address space when thecomputer is in 24 bit mode. And a Mac II seems to usuallydraw in 24 bit mode. When more Video RAM is needed for therequested compile time options, Mini vMac uses addressspace from adjacent NuBus slots. </p><p> * Fixed&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_min_extn">-min-extn</a>&rdquo;build option in the Linux version. </p><!--<p> * Improved FPU emulation, originally written for Mini vMacby Ross Martin. This code was modified touse SoftFloat, by John Hauser (as found used in the Bochs emulator),plus some extensions to SoftFloat by Stanislav Shwartsman(also found in Bochs).Though using SoftFloat is slower than using native floating point,it ensures consistent results on different computers,and makes it easier to compile with different development environments.There's still a lot of work to do on the FPU emulation, but it alreadyallows much more software for the Mac II to run without crashing. </p>--><p> <a name="build"> <b> Build System </b> </a> </p> <!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * Added build system option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_api">-api cco</a>&rdquo;to use Apple's Cocoa API for OS X rather than thedeprecated Carbon API. But the Cocoa port of Mini vMacis not yet considered quite ready to be officially supported,and so the Carbon version is still used. </p><p> * Added build system option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_api">-api sdl</a>&rdquo;to use the<a href="http://www.libsdl.org">Simple DirectMedia Layer</a>1.2 API.  This was added as a stepping stone to the Cocoa port - bycombining the source code for SDL with the source code foran SDL port of Mini vMac, and then removing everything notneeded, and then a lot of cleaning up until an initialnative Cocoa port emerged. However the SDL port canbe used as is to port to other platforms supported bySDL. But this is not (yet) officially supported. </p><p> * Added build system option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_t">-t mx64</a>&rdquo;for Apple's X11 implementationon x86-64. (Previously x86-32 and PowerPC were supported.) </p><p> * Added build system option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_e">-t cygw</a>&rdquo;for Cygwin/X for Microsoft Windows.Cygwin can also be used to compile the regular Microsoft Windows versionwith &ldquo;-t wx86 -e cyg&rdquo;. </p><p> * Added build system option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_t">-t irix</a>&rdquo;for IRIX by Silicon Graphics, Inc., thanksto <a href="http://www.ripserve.com/perkins/">John Perkins</a>. </p><p> * MinGW can be used to compile Mini vMac with build systemoption&ldquo;-t wx86 <a href="../develop.html#option_e">-e mgw</a>&rdquo;.Since Bloodshed Dev-C++ is based on MinGW,&ldquo;-t wx86 -e dvc -cl&rdquo; would previously give similar results.</p><p> * Changed order of arguments to the link command when buildingthe Linux version. It turns out there is a conventional order forhow libraries should be specified, which I didn't know since I hadn'tcome a across a linker that cared until Ubuntu 11.10. </p><p> * The build system should now work properly in other emulatorssuch as SheepShaver. It was anonymously reported that the build systemwould crash emulators. The test for whether the build system was runningin Mini vMac (so that the resulting archive may be exported to the host)was not good enough. </p><p> * The build system now suppresses warning messagesthat were generated when compiling the Macintosh II emulationwith Microsoft Visual C++, thanks to a report from William Grana.</p><p> : </p><p> If you find Mini vMac useful, please consider<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</A>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html"><img src="https://www.gryphel.com/d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p> Back up to - <b><a href="index.html">Changes in Mini vMac versions</a></b></p><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="index.html">change</a>/v3.3- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2013 Paul C.
