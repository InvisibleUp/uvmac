For applications that can run in System 6 or earlier,&ldquo;<a href="../autoquit/index.html">AutoQuit</a>&rdquo; may be preferred. </p><p> To use AutQuit7, copy the application to a new folder on your System 7disk. Then make an alias of the application and move the aliasto the &ldquo;Startup Items&rdquo; folder within the&ldquo;System Folder&rdquo;. Do not place the AutQuit7 applicationdirectly in the &ldquo;Startup Items&rdquo; folder, becauseitems in the same folder as AutQuit7 modify its behavior,and you don&rsquo;t want to mix up these items with the&ldquo;Startup Items&rdquo;. </p><p> In the simplest case of using AutQuit7, when there are noother items in the folder containing it, then (afterthe next restart) Mini vMac willautomatically quit when you shut down the emulated machine.The way it works is that AutQuit7 is a backgroundonly application, and on shut down the system tellsall background applications to quit. At this time AutQuit7sets a flag within Mini vMac, which causes Mini vMac to quitwhen the last disk is ejected. (This flag isn&rsquo;t just alwaysset, because it is possible to eject all disks evenwhen not shutting down.) This behavior is basicallythe same as using&ldquo;<a href="../ejctquit/index.html">EjctQuit</a>&rdquo;,but doesn&rsquo;t require System 7.5. (It requires System 7 orlater.) Like EjctQuit, AutQuit7 will not quitMini vMac if the shift key is down. </p><p> If you make an alias of an application, and placethe alias in the same folder as AutQuit7, andthen rename the alias to &ldquo;app&rdquo;,then AutQuit7 will launch the application atstartup. Furthermore, when this applicationquits, the system notifies AutQuit7, andAutQuit7 then tells the system to shut down.(And then, as in the previous case, Mini vMacquits.) </p><p> If you make an alias of a document, and placethe alias in the same folder as AutQuit7, andthen rename the alias to &ldquo;doc&rdquo;,then AutQuit7 will tell the application&ldquo;app&rdquo; to open the documentat launch. </p><p> If either &ldquo;app&rdquo; or &ldquo;doc&rdquo;are an alias pointing onto a disk that isnot currently mounted, then AutQuit7 willwait up to 15 seconds for the disk to mount.However, the Macintosh system software canmistakenly decide that an already mounteddisk is the disk it is looking for, particularlyif it has the same creation date as thecorrect disk. So if you use one of the&ldquo;<a href="../blanks/index.html">Blanks</a>&rdquo;set of pre-made disk images, you may wantto erase the disk image before using it(with the &ldquo;Erase Disk...&rdquo; command in theSpecial menu of the Finder)to make sure it has a unique creation date. </p><p> If you create a new folder in the same folderas AutQuit7, and rename the new folder to&ldquo;cf&rdquo;, then AutQuit7 will includeall the functionality of&ldquo;<a href="../clockfix/index.html">ClockFix</a>&rdquo;.This feature is included because there is someminimum overhead to a background application, andso it is less expensive to have one combinedbackground application instead of needingboth AutQuit7 and ClockFix. If theClockFix functionality is enabled, thenAutQuit7 will take a small amountof processor time about once a second,otherwise essentially no processor timeis used. That may be a reason fornot enabling this functionality whenit isn&rsquo;t needed. </p><p> Warning: according to Apple&rsquo;s Technical Note TN1126,&ldquo;All applications and Background Only Applicationsshould have a memory partition set to at least 64K. This ensuresthere is always enough room for the system and extensions towork in the application&rsquo;s heap.&rdquo;  The memory partitionfor AutQuit7 is set to 15K, and it seems to work, but itis possible there could be a problem depending on whatextensions are installed. If so you can increase thememory partition of AutQuit7. </p><p>Here is the md5 checksum for the download, signed with<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------296954b3b99ad2ab2e453a28ae63e42a autquit7-1.4.1.zip------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/EyNno/Sn5mPjC8LQB1pknjYuRkBcLNVieK0ZWYPCVVMCJuA2imn0ywGa4Y9Svkg4xVjVOcd45zelH9Jj84LylqsqKp4im/Y0KQu5olnOtx6ZISTAMDze2bgfm/84zWENQem2uEwqwo0MWvm3q0DFYI+Qe7MtPq77lXM3cSULwatY+oL-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling AutQuit7 from the source code. </p><p> You can redistribute AutQuit7 and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
