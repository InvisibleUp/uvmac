As described in the<a href="../../hardware.html#rtc">Real Time Clock</a>documentation, the clock of the emulated computer maybecome inaccurate when the emulation is paused, suchas when switching to another application and thenback to Mini vMac. One work around is toopen the Alarm Clock desk accessory. ClockFix isan alternative that may use less time and space.It also has the advantage of not appearing inthe list of running applications in theApplication menu, and the &ldquo;Hide Others&rdquo;command of that menu won&rsquo;t disable it. </p><p> To use ClockFix, place it in the &ldquo;Startup Items&rdquo;folder inside the &ldquo;System Folder&rdquo; and restart. </p><p> About once a second (by the emulated computer&rsquo;s time),ClockFix calls &ldquo;ReadDateTime&rdquo; whichreloads the copy of time kept in memory fromthe Real Time Clock. </p><p> ClockFix does use some time and space, so it should notbe used if an inaccurate clock doesn&rsquo;t matter. You canuse it if you want the modification dates of filesyou are editing to be accurate. You would notgenerally need to use it for games. </p><p> Warning: according to Apple&rsquo;s Technical Note TN1126,&ldquo;All applications and Background Only Applicationsshould have a memory partition set to at least 64K. This ensuresthere is always enough room for the system and extensions towork in the application&rsquo;s heap.&rdquo;  The memory partitionfor ClockFix is set to 10K, and it seems to work, but itis possible there could be a problem depending on whatextensions are installed. If so you can increase thememory partition of ClockFix. </p><p> ClockFix should not be used on a real Macintosh. Forone thing, it would be pointless. For another, apart of the Macintosh Family Hardware Reference seemsto raise the possibility that ClockFix might drainthe clock&rsquo;s battery faster. </p><p> If you use <a href="../autquit7/index.html">AutQuit7</a>, thenClockFix is not needed, since AutQuit7 optionallyincludes all the functionality of ClockFix. </p><p>Here is the md5 checksum for the download, signed with<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------b9d735c1c3ff5240b7df3bfe53e71c51 clockfix-1.2.0.zip------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/DVckcyqXQP5qU3E3Si+1WNxhZ3lG1wnNir+uUhuxyEDBhVeObcWxiwi2LgXhOB+EF+KvCkOVYe6pOd9GkktxU6PbhxQtK2vFcRM0IvWzj5GMC9tJuH8oAo6EgqwMKQJyrgMn/YKrh+4rI1uAg3UwI/g7tMjys3ncac/N1m3y4R9Lhxl-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling ClockFix from the source code. </p><p> You can redistribute ClockFix and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
