As described on the AutoQuit page, wrappingan application involves setting it to be the Start Up applicationon a System 6 or earlier boot disk. However, some applicationscan not be set to be the Start Up application, presumablydue to the bug of not initializing everythingthat needs to be. (For example,<a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Alice.txt">Alice</a>,the first Macintosh game. Or at least the version I&rsquo;ve seen, whichmight be an early version as it lacks features described in the article.) </p><p> To use DoLaunch, rename the problem application to &ldquo;app&rdquo;,copy the DoLaunch application to the same folder, and setDoLaunch to be the Start Up application. Then you can use therest of the instructions on the<a href="../autoquit/index.html">AutoQuit</a>page. </p><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling DoLaunch from the source code. </p><p> <a name="alpha"> <b>Alpha version</b> in development </a> </p><p>The binary of the Alpha version is so far identical to the stableversion above, but the source code is different, being portedto <a href="../reasm/index.html">ReAsm</a>.</p><p> Download Alpha </p><blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/d/minivmac/extras/dolaunch/dolaunch191208.zip">dolaunch191208.zip</a>(<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/d/minivmac/extras/dolaunch/dolaunch191208.inf.txt">info</a>)a zipped hfs disk image and checksum file.The disk image can be mounted with Mini vMac.Includes source code. </p></blockquote><p>Here is the md5 checksum for the Alpha download, signed with<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------1cd0757f75de96e1ca7ff6c560db534d dolaunch191208.zip------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/IOIc2R/hlrlbHq2zycyQtG87ueUbM6kQosj3szjVzqiegKV1sKjWupTmwa6cDdhhT5JM69gQw84R1hLTJfcR2EVYbOOPyw8z15yCrb+e2XoOEoS3wcTA3+KdUd6wRynUE+z3IJJerANgxWFfJ3L371FhJJUQ9GMZGxz+OyvdwRODadM-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p> You can redistribute DoLaunch and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
