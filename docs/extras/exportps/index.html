You can then exportthis file to the host computer, and print it from there.See the "How can I print from Mini vMac?" questionin the <a href="../../faq.html">FAQ</a>.</p><p> ExportPS is specialized variation of<a href="../exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a> that saves a few steps.The differences from ExportFl are that: </p><blockquote><p> * It does not ask which file to export, butinstead looks for a file named "PostScript"in the folder containing the ExportPSapplication. ("PostScript" is the defaultname saved by the printing dialog.) </p><p> * The default name in the save dialogon the host computer is "PostScript.ps".(The ".ps" extension allows operatingsystems such as OS X to recognize thatit is a PostScript file.) </p><p> * When finished exporting, itdeletes the "PostScript" file. (So thatthe next time you try to print youwon't need to confirm replacing theprevious "PostScript" file.) </p><p> * It then automatically quits. (Itcan't export anything else, so itmight as well quit, so that youcan get back to the applicationyou printed from quicker.) </p></blockquote></p><p> <b> important </b> : You should avoid switching awayfrom Mini vMac to another application until ExportPS quits.If you switch away while ExportPS is still running,the exported file will not be valid yet. Bydefault, Mini vMac pauses emulation when it is not theactive application. (Even in this case, once you switch backto Mini vMac then ExportPS should complete successfully.)</p><p>Here is the md5 checksum for the download, signed with<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------e0d852075cba0de61a93c4121664fd50 exportps-1.0.0.zip------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/Ag+C+RzTmh5utxpnQpIPCytVGTGm5S78y65hXIxCvNhwNG373C8i7e4nvRw8rtgWajuVaizqIeLukcV6fw/jR8mF04lHkdDtzcvrUYYmyeMgKxuAE2gGcYMb6WqH3hAwsuGIkuLCrp9wen7ymt9quWs2sj+F80nZ5w6C2uE5TLWSa2I-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling ExportPS from the source code. </p><p> You can redistribute ExportPS and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
