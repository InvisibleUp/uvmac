Mount the fdplusv3-0.4.3 disk image, and importa copy of the Macintosh Plus ROM onto it. (Such as by using<a href="../../importfl/index.html">ImportFl</a>.) Mount thefdisasm-1.2.8 disk image, copy the FDisasm applicationto the fdplus disk image, and then eject the fdisasmimage. Rename the ROM imageto &ldquo;bin&rdquo;, and then launch the FDisasm application. Theprogram displays a progress indicator, and quits whenit is finished. (It could take five minutes at 1x speed,so set speed to &ldquo;all out&rdquo;. At &ldquo;all out&rdquo; speed ittakes under 10 seconds to finish on my Mac Mini.) When the programfinishes, the output is in a file named &ldquo;listing&rdquo;.</p><p>This listing file is over 2 megabytes. The programMPW Shell 3.2.3 works in Mini vMac and can work with suchlarge text files. But probably almost nobody else has anold copy of MPW. (The final version of MPW still availablefor free download requires a Mac II or later.) Insteadyou can export the listing file to the host computer(such as by using <a href="../../exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>),and find some program there that can view it. (ForOS X, TextWrangler would work, for example.)</p><p><b>Warning</b> : Not enough people are payingenough attention to FDisasm (especially me) forit to be relied upon. If you notice somethingodd in the output, double check it, and ifit is wrong, please report it to<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">me</a>.</p><p>This listing file is derived (in terms of copyrightlaw) from the Macintosh Plus ROM, and so may not beredistributed.</p><p>To disassemble the Macintosh 128/512 ROM, follow the aboveinstructions, except use the fdmac128-0.3.0 disk image, andof course use a ROM image from a Macintosh 128 or 512.And similarly for the Macintosh SE, MacintoshII, and PowerBook 100 ROMs.</p><p>Here are some details about the formatting informationfiles used by FDisasm:</p><p>The only file required by FDisasm is &ldquo;bin&rdquo;. But if this isall it finds, it will just create a hexadecimal dump ofthe file. To disassemble code, it needs to know wherethe code is. It looks for a file named &ldquo;bin_map&rdquo; forthis information. It also looks for a file named &ldquo;bin_names&rdquo;for names of locations within &ldquo;bin&rdquo;, and for a filenamed &ldquo;abs_names&rdquo; for names of absolute memory locations,and for a file named &ldquo;trap_names&rdquo; for names of A-lineinstructions. A file named &ldquo;format&rdquo; can give additionalformatting information, and comments to include in the listing.</p><p>The<a href="../../findcode/index.html">FindCode</a>tool can help to create the files &ldquo;bin_map&rdquo; and&ldquo;bin_names&rdquo;.</p><p>The<a href="../../findres/index.html">FindRes</a>tool will createan initial &ldquo;format&rdquo; file for Macintosh resources, andalso &ldquo;bin_map&rdquo; and a set of entry points to feedto FindCode.</p><p>Besides ROM images, FDisasm can also disassembleMacintosh 680x0 applications. But the code and otherresources are located in the &ldquo;resource fork&rdquo; of suchappplications, while FDisasm only operateson the &ldquo;data fork&rdquo; of the file &ldquo;bin&rdquo;.The <a href="../../getrsfrk/index.html">GetRsFrk</a> tool getsthe resource fork of a file you select, and savesit into the data fork of &ldquo;bin&rdquo;.An alternative is<a href="../../aspack/index.html">asPack</a>,which also saves the data fork and the meta data into &ldquo;bin&rdquo;,in AppleSingle format.</p><p>FDisasm has some compile time options. The default values aredefined in &ldquo;source/CNFGDLFT.i&rdquo;, and these defaultscan be changed in &ldquo;source/CONFIGUR.i&rdquo;. For example,the following variation does not output the address and hexfields, resulting in output that is suitable for passing to anassembler:</p><p> Download </p><blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/d/minivmac/extras/fdisasm/c/fdis0002-1.2.8.zip">fdis0002-1.2.8.zip</a>(25K) variation of FDisasm. </p></blockquote><p>The software that has become FDisasm, FindCode, andFindRes was my first serious programmingproject, started in 1985 in Basic, and later convertedto Pascal, and now converted to C when I got back toit recently.

Ifeel this is better style.<a href="../../reasm/index.html">ReAsm</a>currently requires this. There are also some new compile timeoptions for improving compatibility with ReAsm, such as forcinglabels to be on a separate line, and using tab to indent instructions.These options are used in the fdis0002 variation.</p><p><b> February 17, 2019 </b>version 1.2.7 fixes a bug<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/mail/v9.html#m129">reported by Ryan</a>that affected disassembling floating point conditionallong branches. It also partially reverts for now a change madein 1.2.6. If an instruction (or data) that is about to be output islonger than the space left to be disassembled, it will nownot abort outputting the instruction, and just give a warning.This version also starts to provide ways to avoid the situationsthat lead to this problem. Disassembly of PC relative addressingmodes can now use the AC and SC options for adding or subtractinga constant. There is a new &lsquo;,&rsquo; option to indicate whichargument options like AC and SC apply to. It also now checks thatsuch one time options are actually used by the current instruction,and prints a warning if not.</p><p><b> January 6, 2019 </b>version 1.2.6 adds a &ldquo;BN&rdquo; option to modify &ldquo;B&rdquo;,&ldquo;W&rdquo; or &ldquo;L&rdquo; options to output binary instead ofhex. Also, if an instruction (or data) that is about to be output islonger than the space left to be disassembled, then the output isaborted, and the remaining space is output as data of unknown format.Also, the AM option (which modifies the D option) now can take anaddress as well as a name, and checks the address is correct. Similarlythe J option can now take a name, making the JM option obsolete. The&ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;H&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Z&rdquo; options havebeen changed to compile time options, which can be specified in thenew file &ldquo;CONFIGUR.i&rdquo; with the default values specifiedin &ldquo;CNFGDLFT.i&rdquo;.</p><p><b> December 30, 2018 </b>version 1.2.5 properly limits the size of the hex field. Previouslythe hex field would be incorrect for very long lines, such as can begenerated with the new &ldquo;C&rdquo; option. (For the future,it would be good to limit the length of lines generated by thisoption.)</p><p><b> December 23, 2018 </b>version 1.2.4 adds an &ldquo;AL&rdquo; option in the format filefor aligment relative to a base address.</p><p><b> December 16, 2018 </b>version 1.2.3 adds a &ldquo;C&rdquo; option in the format filefor text fields. Also, for the &ldquo;D&rdquo; option (offsetfields), there are three new modifiers: &ldquo;AC&rdquo; for anadded constant, &ldquo;SC&rdquo; for a subtracted constant,and &ldquo;DC&rdquo; for a constant devided by.</p><p><b> December 9, 2018 </b>version 1.2.2 adds the ability to specify labels in the format file (inaddition to the &ldquo;bin_names&rdquo; file), so that a single addresscan have multiple labels. Also in the format file, you can now specify aone time name to use in an address field argument (overriding the&ldquo;bin_names&rdquo; file). Similarly, in the format file, can youspecify a name to use for the current base address used by the D option.The FindRes tool has been updated to begin to take advantage.</p><p><b> July 13, 2016 </b>version 1.2.1 adds the ability to format jump table offsetsas the difference between two symbolic labels (insteadof only listing the numeric value).Mac Plus and Mac 128K formatting information has been updated totake advantage.</p><p><b> July 1, 2016 </b>version 1.2.0 adds initial support for FPU instructions,and works well enough to correctly disassemblethe Floating-Point Arithmetic Package (PACK 4)of the Macintosh II ROM (verified with the MPW Assembler).The disk image with theMac II formatting information has also been updated.</p><p><b> June 24, 2016 </b>version 1.1.9 now works well enough that feeding the outputto the MPW Assembler gets back the original binary forthe Macintosh II ROM. Except that the Floating-Point Arithmetic Package(PACK 4) is not disassembled because FPU instructionsare not yet handled. The disk image with theMac II formatting information has also been updated.</p><p>The specific changes include:The 68020 forms of Mul and Div instructions are now supported.Also the ExtB.L instruction. A bug in MoveC is fixed.A bug in Bitfield register width argument is fixed.And also the code is restructured a bit to better matchthe code in Mini vMac CPU emulation, for easier comparison.</p><p><b> June 15, 2016 </b>version 1.1.8 now works well enough that feeding the outputto the MPW Assembler gets back the original binary forthe Macintosh PowerBook 100 ROM. Even though the PowerBook100 has a 68000 CPU, this ROM has some 68020 code. FDisasmcan now better handle the full extension word format ofaddressing mode 6, the absolute long addressing mode,and the Bitfield instructions. The disk image with thePowerBook 100 formatting information has also been updated.</p><p><b> January 1, 2015 </b>version 1.1.7 now works well enough that feeding the outputto the MPW Assembler gets back the original binary forthe Macintosh Plus ROM, the Macintosh 128/512 ROM, andthe Macintosh SE ROM.</p><p>This involved figuring out what syntax the MPW Assembleraccepts for PC relative address mode, when not usinga symbolic label. (It is expecting an address, not the offset.)The MoveC instruction is now better supported. And thereis a fix for the MoveP instruction.</p><p>The disk images with formatting information have been updatedfor Macintosh Plus ROM, the Macintosh 128/512 ROM, andthe Macintosh SE ROM. The '.' character in labels is notaccepted by the MPW Assembler, and so replaced with '_'.Also, in a few cases, two addresses were labeled with the samename. But only one of the two are used by the ROM, andso the other label was removed.</p><p><b> December 30, 2014 </b>version 1.1.6 fixes incorrect size field for BTST instructionas reported by<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/">Steve Chamberlin</a>.There are also a number of other changes to better allowthe MPW Assembler to assemble the output of FDisasm andget back the original binary.</p><p><b> December 28, 2014 </b>version 1.1.5 changes format of negative hex numbers from&ldquo;$-A&rdquo; to &ldquo;-$A&rdquo;, so as to workwith the Easy 68K assembler, as requested by<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/">Steve Chamberlin</a>.</p><p><b> December 26, 2014 </b>version 1.1.4 fixes a number of bugs reported by<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/">Steve Chamberlin</a>.</p><p><b> May 17, 2014 </b>fdmac128-0.4.1 includes information<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/mail/v1.html#140517a">reported by Tom Frikker</a>about initials at the end of the Mac 128k ROM. This lead to finding a<a href="http://macgui.com/news/article.php?t=336">report by &lsquo;Dog Cow&rsquo;</a>about more initials in the Twiggy Mac ROM (for an early prototype).So there may only be two initials in the Mac 128k ROM because therest got overwritten, like happened in later versions of the MacintoshPlus ROM.</p><p><b> September 12, 2012 </b>version 1.1.3 includes code from<a href="http://www.synack.net/~bbraun/">Rob Braun</a>for the "pmove, pload, andpflush family of instructions for the 68851 and 68030".</p><p><b> September 7, 2012 </b>version 1.1.2 includes a bug fix from<a href="http://www.synack.net/~bbraun/">Rob Braun</a>.A 32 bit offsetfor the Bsr or Bra instruction was not decoded correctly.</p><p><b> October 6, 2011 </b>fdplus-0.4.0 merges in changes from<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/">Steve Chamberlin</a>,that "added many morecomments of my own, and many new meaningful names forpreviously-unamed routine entry points, especially in areasrelated to the boot sequence and Sony disk driver".</p><p><b> September 25, 2011 </b>new versions of all the formatting information disk images,removing the FDisasm application.
