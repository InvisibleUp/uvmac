LaunchFindRes and when it is finished files named"format", "entries", and "bin_map" willl be created. </p><p> If "bin_map" already exists it will be updated.FindRes will mark in the "bin_map" file areas of"bin" that are definitely not code, and leavethe rest untouched.(The "format" and "entries" files will be completely replacedif they already exist.) </p><p> The contents of the "entries" file can be passed tothe FindCode tool. Youneed to open it in a text editor and copy it all, andthen paste in FindCode. FindCode as yet has no wayto read the file directly. </p><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling FindRes from the source code. </p><p> You can redistribute FindRes and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
