It is like the &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; command,except that it uses the clipboard of the real computer insteadof the clipboard of the emulated computer. The keyboard shortcutis Command-Option-V. (The &ldquo;Host Paste&rdquo; command hassimilar effect to using<a href="../clipin/index.html">ClipIn</a>and then the normal &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; command.)</p><p> Then click on the status bar, at the bottomof the window below the editing area.(Choosing the &lsquo;Go&rsquo; command from the File menu,of the emulated Macintosh, will also work. The keyboard shortcutis Command-G.) </p><p>The editing area is cleared. Next paste in the public keyfor the signed message.For this example:</p><blockquote><pre>----- BEGIN GRY PUBLIC KEY -----Gry+PKAIAAA/AXuKqWsF8Rh5Ie4/vORBnTxYf8FPpRl/n6hpgDgfJ5MAOsAEyePEnSfjmL3I9emNTuW/iCIHlCl/WkaWyMQZ+NDb1ZsnSLyOKwOycVkR3JwJbUamM4wyjUuoWV6jzuhqWZobpGPMSN4B3ivHXtcNVm5SVmnAL13T4FCLnx+TxaYRAQABwA54------ END GRY PUBLIC KEY ------</pre></blockquote><p>Before continuing, it would be a good idea to set Mini vMac to<a href="../../hardware.html#processor">All Out speed</a>.Then, on a modern computer, SigCheckshould take less than a second to run. At 1x speed, or on a realMacintosh Plus, it takes much longer. The code of SigCheck is intendedto be simple to understand and maintain, as opposed to fast.</p><p>Now, click on the status bar again. Ifall is well, the status bar should say&ldquo;Good Signature.&rdquo; Otherwise you should getan alert with some error message. </p><p>If SigCheck says the signature is good, that is strong evidencethat the message was signed by the owner of the public key(the person who has the corresponding secret key). But you should beaware of a number of weaknesses:</p><p>First, the key might not belong to who you think it does. If someone hashacked the Gryphel Project website, or is intercepting all trafficbetween you and the website, then they can replace the public keysdisplayed on this website as well. So you shouldn&rsquo;t just get thekey from the website whenever you need it, you should save your owncopy. That still doesn&rsquo;t protect you when you first get the key.One possible protection is to find other copies of the key on the weband compare them.</p><p>Second, the key might have been stolen. Once anyone else knows thesecret key, it is pretty much useless. Securing information on acomputer is a difficult problem. Actually, it is impossible to provethat a computer is completely secure. A computer not connected to theinternet is much more likely to be secure, but that is usuallyimpractical.</p><p>Third, the key might have been broken. The security of a key depends onthe difficulty of factoring a large number into two primes. In 2009, a768 bit key was broken. As of this writing (2018), no one has publiclybroken a 1024 bit key, however there have been predictions that it wouldbe possible around now. It is quite possible that some large governmentorganization now has that capability. Even if that is so, for most usesa 1024 bit key is probably still safe for signing. The capability wouldmost likely be quietly used for decrypting. Forgingsignatures would make that capability publicly known, and so lessuseful.</p><p>Forth, the digest algorithm might have been broken. SigCheck computesa 40 byte digest from the message to compare with the decodedsignature. I believe it to be impractical to construct anothermessage that results in the same digest. But if someone figures out how,that would make SigCheck useless.</p><p>SigCheck is in part descended from MacPGP source code, which, as far asI can tell, allows derived works for noncommercial use. <!-- SigCheck isgenerally compatible with MacPGP, but it is easier to legallydistribute, since it doesn&rsquo;t do cryptography. Since it only doesone thing it should also be easier to use. --></p><p>If a file named &ldquo;pub_key.txt&rdquo; exists in thesame folder as the application, then SigCheck will not askfor the public key, but instead get it from that file.So you can save time for a frequently used key by setting upa copy of SigCheck this way. You can save even more time by&ldquo;wrapping&rdquo; this copy of SigCheck with<a href="../autoquit/index.html">AutoQuit</a>.</p><p>The first 12 characters in a signature after the &ldquo;Gry/&rdquo;(after the &ldquo;BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE&rdquo; line), shouldmatch the first 12 characters in the public key after thefirst &ldquo;/&rdquo;.In the above example, &ldquo;AXuKqWsF8Rh5&rdquo;.So if you have a text file with many public keys, you caneasily search for the right key for a signature.</p><p><a href="../sigchktl/index.html">SigChkTl</a>is a command line version of SigCheck.</p><p>SigCheck is a successor to<a href="../psgcheck/index.html">PSgCheck</a>,which uses a different format that is more or less compatiblewith MacPGP.</p><p>Here is the md5 checksum for the download, signed with<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------46757c0a10d20e1d52927bdc6f2325f5 sigcheck-1.1.0.zip------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/NC5C7bO9uPNVmJPZvd31PACtsQToj77XzzrikfELiUwjDzvxFD4GrylqGqMLc863DgDlnno920kTkdIWXoLGo4zBe96kwvu8UU8puOXuB/7JnFYBDhfT7tzljE0pXd+8Sld/bsSMptWliotg4mMbbbKJ5ItijZFRybi4KZ+jg0Xw+lA-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling SigCheck from the source code. </p><p> : </p><p> If you find SigCheck useful, please consider<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</a>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html"><img src="https://www.gryphel.com/d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="../index.html">extras</a>/sigcheck- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2018 Paul C.
