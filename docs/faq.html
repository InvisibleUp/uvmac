What doI do? </b> </p><p> Ask on one of the various internet<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/forums/index.html">forums related to Mini vMac</a>.</p><h2> Support requests </h2><p> <b> How do I get my Macintosh programs and other filesinto Mini vMac?</b> </p><p>To use a program or other file with Mini vMac, youneed to get it into a disk image. The recommended way to do thisis with the <a href="extras/importfl/index.html">ImportFl</a>utility.</p><p> <b> How can I read a floppy disk that was writtenon a Mac Plus? </b> </p><p> Modern machines can&rsquo;t read the 400k and 800k floppy disksused by the Mac Plus. This a hardware problem, not solvable insoftware - they lack the variable speed motor of the old drives.I don&rsquo;t know any reason why some company couldn&rsquo;t now manufacturea floppy drive that reads the old disks, but I&rsquo;m not aware ofanyone doing so. </p><p> So the only way to read such disks is to<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/buymac/index.html">get an old Mac</a>.A somewhat later Mac than the Mac Plus would be useful, one that canread 400/800k floppies, but has some options for talking to modernmachines, such as 1.4M floppies or ethernet. </p><p> An alternative is to hire someone to do this for you. See the<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/convert/index.html">Old Macintosh Disk Conversion Services</a>page for some possibilities. </p><p> <b> How can I print from Mini vMac? </b> </p><p> There is no direct support for printing, but you can use theability built into System 6.0.8 and later to print toa Postscript file. You can then export this file to the hostcomputer, and print it from there. </p><p> To print to a Postscript file, select LaserWriter in theChooser, then print from your application as normal, exceptthat in the print dialog, choose PostScript File as thedestination. To transfer the resulting file to the hostcomputer you can use <a href="extras/exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>.The Preview application in Macintosh OS X 10.4 or later can open andprint PostScript files. (The name of the file should endwith ".ps" to allow Preview to recognize it as PostScript.)Other operating systems may requireadditional software to print PostScript files. </p><p>When selecting LaserWriter in the Chooser, you can ignorethe warning about requiring AppleTalk. The print to file feature of thisdriver will work without AppleTalk. Choosing Cancel is fine, whichleaves AppleTalk off. Choosing OK, which turns AppleTalk on, isalso fine. The standard Mini vMac variationwithout LocalTalk emulation still tries to correctly emulate the serialport, with no LocalTalk network attached, which is sufficient forturning on AppleTalk. (AppleTalk is the protocols thatare used to talk over the LocalTalk network hardware.)</p><p> <a href="extras/exportps/index.html">ExportPS</a> is aspecialized variation of ExportFl that saves a fewsteps when printing. </p><p> Warning : printing to a Postscript file in System 6.0.8 hassometimes been observed to generate invalid Postscript.This problem may be fixed in later System versions. I'venot had trouble with my preferred version:System 7.1 with System Update 3.0.</p><p> <a name="rom"> <b>Can you send me a ROM image? </b> </a> </p><p> No. </p><p> That would be a violation of copyright law.I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is thatit is ok to producea product that might be used for illegal purposes, solong as there sufficient legal use for it.Therefore I try to emphasize thatMini vMac can be used legally. The legalmethod is to own an old Macintosh(see the<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/buymac/index.html">Buy Mac</a> page)and extract the ROM image (see<a href="extras/copyroms/index.html">CopyRoms</a>)for your own private use. (Some people thinkthat this isn&rsquo;t legal either, but thatisn&rsquo;t my understanding of U.S. copyrightlaw, though I am not a lawyer, and laws coulddiffer in other countries.) </p><p> <b> I own an old Macintosh that I can&rsquo;t extractthe ROM image from (because it is broken,or because I don&rsquo;t have the means to make itcommunicate with newer machines).Can you send me the ROM image? </b> </p><p> Sorry, no. </p><p> That would still be a copyright violation.It only reduces the chance that anyone wouldcare. (I think, I am not a lawyer.)Speaking of caring, as far as I knowApple doesn&rsquo;t seem to have botheredlately to stop the various illegal copiesof Macintosh 68k ROMs floating around the web.But I expect there would be limitsto their tolerance. </p><p> <b> Will you tell me where to find an illegalROM image? </b> </p><p> Of course not. </p><p> <b> Why do I get a message that the ROM image may be corrupted? </b> </p><p> Some of the illegal ROM images floating around the webare in fact corrupted. </p><p> <b> Can you provide a bootable disk image? </b> </p><p> No. This would require Apple System Software, involving issuessimilar to those mentioned above for ROM images. Except that<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/sw/system/index.html">System Software</a>may be downloaded freely from Apple. </p><p> <b> What System Software versions can be used with Mini vMac? </b> </p><p> Mini vMac can currently be used with up to System Software 7.5.5, andany earlier version back to the earliest known prereleases.  In theorysome (distant) future version of Mini vMac may be able to work with up toMac OS 8.1, the last version to work on a 680x0 Macintosh.Later system software, starting with 8.5, runs only on a PowerPCMacintosh. </p><p> <b> Which emulation should I use (Mac Plus, Mac 128K, Mac SE)? </b> </p><p> Which version to use depends on what ROM image you have.If you have all of them then the Mac Plus emulation is probably preferable.There are few detectable differences in the Mac SE emulation, and it&rsquo;snot as well tested. The Mac 128K emulation can run some very earlysoftware that won&rsquo;t run on a Mac Plus, but a lot of software thatworks on the Mac Plus won&rsquo;t work on a Mac 128K (and only 128K ofmemory is very limiting). The Mac Plus was sold for the longest periodof any Macintosh model, and so software written over a long period oftime works well on it. </p><p> <b> Why doesn&rsquo;t the ROM from a Mac SE/30 or Mac SE FDHD work in theMac SE version of Mini vMac? </b> </p><p> As described on the <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/mac68k/index.html">Mac 68k page</a>, the Mac SE/30 and theMac SE FDHD are different machines from the Mac SE, and usedifferent ROMs.I believe the Mac SE FDHD is quite similar to the Macintosh SE,but it has been reported that it is not close enough for theMacintosh SE FDHD ROM to work in the Macintosh SE emulator.The Mac SE/30 is much more different. </p><p> <b> How is Mini vMac different from Basilisk II? </b> </p><p> The biggest current difference is that Mini vMac emulatesthe earliest Macs, while<a href="http://basilisk.cebix.net/">Basilisk II</a>emulates later 680x0 Macs. The fundamental technical differenceis that Basilisk II doesn&rsquo;t emulate hardware, but patches the drivers in ROM, whileMini vMac emulates the hardware (with the exception of the floppy drive). </p><p> The consequences are that some of the earliest Mac software will run in Mini vMac andnot Basilisk II, while much of the later software will run in Basilisk IIand not Mini vMac. For software that will run in either, the emulation inMini vMac can be more accurate, while Basilisk II offers many more features(including color, larger screen, more memory, network access, and more hostintegration). </p><p> Mini vMac aims to stay simple and maintainable.So Mini vMac only has compile time preferences, where as Basilisk II hasmany run time preferences. And Mini vMac uses a rather simple emulation of theprocessor, compared to Basilisk II, which could make Mini vMac slower. </p><h2> Feature requests </h2><p> <b> Color?</b> </p><p> Maybe someday. The next computer that I plan to emulate isthe Mac II, which has color.Meanwhile, you could try Basilisk II. </p><p> <b> Larger screen? </b> </p><p> It might be possible to hack the ROM of the Mac Plus tosupport larger screen sizes. (Actually, the original vMacfor Macintosh supported larger screen sizes, though in away that doesn't work for Mini vMac.) But since it wouldnot be emulating any Mac that ever existed, theredefinitely would be compatibility problems. It would workexcept when it didn't, which is not very satisfactory.If I implemented this, it would mostly be as a steppingstone to emulating later Macs, which is the preferredsolution. </p><p> update: This is now implemented in thestable version. </p><p> <b> More memory? </b> </p><p> The Mac Plus (and Mac SE) can support no more than 4MBof memory, since the RAM starts at address 0 and the ROMis at address 0x00400000 (4MB). </p><p> After figuring out how to patch the ROM to support adifferent size screen, I investigated whether it would bepossible to patch the ROM so that it could functionelsewhere in the address space. The answer was no.The Macintosh System software, in particular the partthat installs bug fixes for traps that otherwise wouldbe implemented ROM, assumes and depends on the exactaddress of the ROM. It would not be enough to patchthe ROM, any System Software version that mightbe used would have to be patched as well. </p><p>The (incomplete) Macintosh II emulation currently supports up8MB. The Macintosh II ROM is not "32-bit clean", and so hasproblems with more memory. But there is a later softwareupdate that is supposed to make a Mac II 32-bit clean(I assume by providing replacements for many of the ROM routines.)Unfortunately this doesn't work in Mini vMac yet, forunknown reasons. Maybe in the future.Meanwhile, you could try Basilisk II.</p><p>I've received a "<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/mail/v2.html#m27">report</a>"that there was a third party upgrade for the original Mac that allowedit to support more than 512K of memory. So presumably it is possiblefor Mini vMac to do the same. I have not investigated this yet.</p><p> <b> Networking? </b> </p><p> Mini vMac does not currently support networking.A real Mac Plus can use TCP/IP over a modem. All that softwarewill work in Mini vMac, but there is no modem emulation.Mini vMac emulates the serial ports with nothing attached.In the future, I&rsquo;m thinking there could be a replacement ofthe Mac Plus TCP/IP software to run inside Mini vMac, thatcould use the Mini vMac extension mechanism to talk to theTCP/IP API of the host operating system.But that is likely quite some way away.Meanwhile, you could try Basilisk II. </p><p> <b> Save PRAM? </b> </p>	<p> A real Macintosh has a small amount of memory that is preservedwhen the computer is turned off. This memory, the PRAM, is used tohold settings such as sound volume, start-up system drive,and printer connection. </p><p> vMac saves this information to a file upon quit,and loads this file on launch. Very early versions of Mini vMacalso did this, until one day Mini vMac stopped working for me.I eventually realized that it was because the saved PRAM wascorrupted. (This was a problem on real Macs too.) To preventsupport headaches, I stopped saving the PRAM state. </p><p> If you compile your own version of Mini vMac, you canchange the initial settings of the PRAM in the source code.A possible future feature for the Mini vMac build systemis to make this easier, by providing build options forthe more useful PRAM settings. </p><p> <b> Preference dialog? </b> </p><p> (For options such as which machine to emulate and how much RAM) </p>	<p> Since the goal is to keep Mini vMac small and simple, easily portable and maintainable,I don&rsquo;t plan to implement any run time preferences, only compile time preferences.Run time options are more complex to implement than compile time options, and wouldmake the program larger. If implemented in a simple way, having to constantly checkwhat machine is being emulated at run time would make the program slower. </p><p> Another major concern is that preference files can get corrupted.(Similar to the PRAM issue mentioned above.) This is a very common problemwith a lot of software. Not having a preference fileprevents this problem. </p><p> I would prefer to continue trying to make it easier to use compile time options.Mini vMac is small enough that you can keep multiple copies of it, eachcustomized to a different use. </p><p> <b> Port to Syllable, SkyOS, Palm, BeOS, Amiga, or ...? </b> </p><p> Porting to other operating systems is fun, and central to the goals of Mini vMac. However, it takes a while forme to learn enough about programming for an operating systemas different as these to port Mini vMac, and relatively few peoplebenefit, so that is not too high a priority for me. </p><p> On the other hand, if someone who is already familiar withan operating system would like to port Mini vMac to it, I'dbe happy to assist, such as by answering questions abouthow Mini vMac works. Mini vMac is intended to be portable, hasbeen ported a number of times already, and is relativelysimple, so I think it should be relatively simple to learn enoughabout Mini vMac to be able to port it to a new operatingsystem (compared to me learning enough to program for a newoperating system). </p><p> <b> Port to Apple II, TRS-80, Atari XL, Commodore 64, or ...? </b> </p><p> In theory, Mini vMac can be ported to anything vaguelyresembling a computer, so long as it has enough storage.So if you&rsquo;re willing to do enough swapping of floppy disks,cassettes, or whatever, then it should be possible.However, it would be very difficult to create such ports,and impractical in the extreme. (As in, boot times measuredin days, months, or years.) </p><p> For a practical Mini vMac port to be possible, a computershould have enough fast memory (RAM) to hold theemulated machine's RAM (minimum 128K for Macintosh)plus the emulated machine's ROM (minimum 64K), plus enoughto hold the code of the emulator. A 16 bit computerlike those mentioned above can only directly access64K of RAM total. Some workarounds are possible,but they are complex, and it is hard to imagine anyonewould ever bother. </p><p> Also, the host computer should preferably be at least 50 times fasterthan the original Macintosh to allow the emulationto run at a useable speed. The computers mentioned aboveare slower than the original Macintosh. (Modern computers arethousands of times faster.) </p><p> <b> Emulation of a Mac LC475 or Quadra650 or IIci or ...? </b> </p><p> Maybe someday. I&rsquo;d like to eventually add emulation of other Macs, startingwith the Mac II. I can&rsquo;t work on emulating the machines in any order;each is a stepping stone to the next. For example the Mac SE was muchlike a Plus except for having to figure out ADB. The Mac II will be amuch bigger step, having a 68020, a 68881 FPU, graphics card, and anew sound chip. But at least I have good documentation for it; I don&rsquo;thave as much for later machines. Later machines also tend to use a68030 or higher, which means having to deal with virtual memory. </p><p> <b> Emulation of a PowerPC Macintosh? </b> </p><p> No. PowerPC emulation will never be in Mini vMac, no matter how long Imaintain it. It is &ldquo;Mini&rdquo; vMac, so one has to draw the line somewhere.Mini vMac is about preserving early Macintosh software. Such software,when written properly, will run efficiently on any 680x0 Macintosh.A PowerPC Macintosh runs this software by emulation. Emulating anemulator is much slower than just one level of emulation. (APowerPC processor is faster than a 680x0 processor, but an emulationof a PowerPC processor is no faster than the emulation of a 680x0 processor.) </p><p> Instead, see&ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SheepShaver">SheepShaver</a>&rdquo;or&ldquo;<a href="http://pearpc.sourceforge.net/">PearPC</a>&rdquo;.</p><p> <b> Emulation of a Lisa? </b> </p><p> In theory, emulation of a Lisa running MacWorks is within the scopeof Mini vMac. But it is not a high priority, since a Lisa is complexto emulate, and emulating it would not greatly advance the primarygoal of preserving early Macintosh software.Instead see Ray Arachelian&rsquo;s&ldquo;<a href="http://lisa.sunder.net/">Lisa Emulator Project</a>&rdquo;.</p> <p> <b> Emulation of an Apple II? </b> </p><p> No. An Apple II has no real similarity to a Macintosh.This is &ldquo;Mini&rdquo; v&ldquo;Mac&rdquo;, if you want one emulatorfor everything, see&ldquo;<a href="https://www.mamedev.org/">MAME</a>&rdquo;.</p><p> <b> Open source ROM replacement? </b> </p><p> No. While on some computers the ROM is relatively simpleand just used to load the operating system, on anearly Macintosh the ROM contains all the core software thatmakes it a Macintosh. The earliest system softwaredoesn't have much more than a few bug fixes. (Which,by the way, is possible because the code in ROM isaccessed through a dispatch table in RAM.) Areplacement for the ROM would be much more complex thanthe whole of Mini vMac, and there would alwaysbe compatibility issues, so long as it wasn'tidentical to Apple's ROM. </p><p> It has been done though. See &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor_(software)">Executor</a>&rdquo;.</p><h2> Other </h2>		<p> <b> What format is the Mini vMac source code in,and why don't you use something more standard? </b> </p><p> It is a zipped hfs disk image. The"<a href="build.html">Building Mini vMac</a>"page describes how to use it. </p><p> The "real" Mini vMac is not an emulator, but a programthat generates source code for various Macintosh 680x0emulators for various development tools. This is the MinivMac build system. The build system is a program that runson a Macintosh 680x0, which allows it be used by anyonewho has Mini vMac (or any other real or emulated 680x0Macintosh). The source code for the build system is in aformat suitable for using with a Macintosh 680x0 Ccompiler. The build system is not made to be portable toother kinds of computers, as that would add much morecomplexity. </p><p> Even if the build system were not needed for generatingall the various variations of Mini vMac, it would still be neededfor supporting the various development tools. There are nostandard source formats that are directly usable on allcomputers and development tools that Mini vMac is portedto. </p><p> <b> What should I do with my old 680x0 Macintosh? </b> </p><p> Keep it, of course. Owning an old Macintosh allows you touse Mini vMac legally. Even if Mini vMac doesn't emulateyour specific 680x0 Macintosh model, it may at some futuredate, or a different emulator may. </p><p> If you really can't keep it, then some of the places listedon the <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/buymac/index.html">Buy Mac</a>page could also be used to sell one. </p><p> : </p><p> Back up to - <b><a href="index.html">Mini vMac</a></b> </p><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/faq- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2020 Paul C.
