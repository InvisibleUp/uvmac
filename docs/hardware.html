A program such as&ldquo;<a href="extras/copyroms/index.html">CopyRoms</a>&rdquo;,when run on a real Macintosh Plus, will savethis information to a file, which can then be transferredto the computer on which you want to run Mini vMac. Note thatthe ROM image file is copyright Apple Computer, and may notbe redistributed.  So to legally use Mini vMac, you need toown a real Macintosh Plus. If you don&rsquo;t have a Macintosh Plus,you could check the&ldquo;<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/buymac/index.html">Where to buy an old Macintosh</a>&rdquo;page. </p><p>When Mini vMac launches, it will look for a ROM image file in a numberof possible locations. If it does not find the ROM image, it will waitfor you to tell it where it is. You can drag the icon of the file ontoto the Mini vMac window. Or, in the Macintosh or Windowsversions, you can choose the &ldquo;Open Disk Image...&rdquo; commandfrom the &ldquo;File&rdquo;<a href="control.html#menu_commands">menu</a>,or the &lsquo;O&rsquo; command from the<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a> to bringup the bring up the standard dialog. Once you have told Mini vMacwhere the ROM image is, booting will resume.</p><p>Before giving up and asking you where the ROM image file is,the first location Mini vMac will look for it is in the foldercontaining the MinivMac application, with the name &ldquo;vMac.ROM&rdquo;.In recent versions of OS X, this will not work bydefault, because of &ldquo;Path Randomization&rdquo; misfeature added inmacOS Sierra (10.12), and also because of Sandboxing, when that isenabled.</p><p> The ROM image file may also be placed elsewhere, with an alias(named &ldquo;vMac.ROM&rdquo;) to it placed in Mini vMac&rsquo;s folder."Alias" is the term used for Macintosh. On Windows you usea "&ldquo;Shortcut&rdquo;" file. (It must be &ldquo;vMac.ROM&rdquo;,not &ldquo;Shortcut to vMac.ROM&rdquo;. Actually, the file is really named&ldquo;vMac.ROM.lnk&rdquo; internally, but what you see is &ldquo;vMac.ROM&rdquo;.)And in the X versions you use a symlink, or  "symbolic link". </p><p> An exception to the above is that in the Mac OS X version,if you create a folder called &ldquo;mnvm_dat&rdquo;inside the &ldquo;Contents&rdquo; folder within the application bundle(control click on the application and choose &ldquo;Show Package Contents&rdquo;),then Mini vMac will look for the &ldquo;vMac.ROM&rdquo; file, and the<a href="hardware.html#floppy_drives">disk1.dsk, disk2.dsk, etc</a> files,within the &ldquo;mnvm_dat&rdquo; folder.This allows you to make a self contained Mac OS X application thatruns an application for the Mac Plus (especially when used with the&ldquo;<a href="extras/autoquit/index.html">AutoQuit</a>&rdquo;software.) </p><p> In the X version, if the folder containing the application can not bedetermined, Mini vMac looks for the ROM image file in the current directory.For example, finding the application directory is not implementedin OpenBSD and Minix. </p><p> Also in the X version, if an argument of the form&ldquo;-r [rom_file]&rdquo; is used on the<a href="control.html#command_line">command line</a>,that is used instead of the application directoryor current directory. Or, if there is an argument ofthe form &ldquo;-d [directory_path]&rdquo;, MinivMac looks for the ROM image in [directory_path]. </p><p> If Mini vMac doesn't find theROM image in the locations described above, it willalso look in a specific central location. In OS X itchecks in "/Users/[your_UserName]/Library/Preferences/Gryphel/mnvm_rom/",and then also in "/Library/Application Support/Gryphel/mnvm_rom/".In Windows 7 and Vista, "C:\Users\[your_UserName]\AppData\Roaming\Gryphel\mnvm_rom\".In Windows XP, "C:\Documents and Settings\[your_UserName]\Application Data\Gryphel\mnvm_rom\".In Windows 98, "C:\WINDOWS\Application Data\Gryphel\mnvm_rom\".In the X Versions, "~/.gryphel/mnvm_rom".And in Macintosh Classic "System Folder:Preferences:Gryphel:mnvm_rom".The "mnvm_rom" folder may be an aliasto where ever you keep your ROM collection. </p><p> Mini vMac will verify the checksum of the ROM on launch. Thereis code in the ROM to do this when the Macintosh Plus boots,but since Mini vMac patches the ROM to replace the disk driver,it also patches the ROM to disable the checksum verification.So Mini vMac does the check itself, before patching the ROM,and gives a warning message if the checksum is incorrect. Sinceno harm can be done no matter what is in the ROM, this is onlya warning, and Mini vMac will keep running. Mini vMac does notcheck if the ROM image file is too long (it should be 128K =131072 bytes). </p><p> There are three different versions of the Macintosh Plus ROM.Versions 2 and 3 work with Mini vMac. The original (and rare)version 1 ROM was recently reported not to work, presumably becauseof problems with SCSI emulation. There are only a fewbytes different in version 2 from version 1, to fix a bug wherethe Macintosh Plus wouldn't boot if an attached SCSI deviceswas not turned on. </p><p> <a name="power_switch"> <b> Power Switch </b> </a> </p><p> <b>On:</b> Launching the Mini vMac application turns on thepower switch of the emulated computer. Double click on theapplications icon to launch Mini vMac in Macintosh or Windows.The application can be launched from the command line in Linuxand Windows. There are also many other ways of launchingapplications for each operating system, such as by installingit into the dock of Macintosh OS X, the Apple menu ofMacintosh OS 9, or the start Menu of Windows. </p><p> <b>Off:</b> Quitting the Mini vMac application is liketurning off the power switch of the emulated computer. Justlike with the real computer, you should shut down the operatingsystem running within the emulated computer first. Mini vMaccan&rsquo;t tell if the emulated operating system has been properlyshut down, but it can tell whether any disk images arecurrently mounted, and so uses that as the test for warnings. </p><p> If no disk images are mounted, Mini vMac can be quit withControl-Q, or by clicking in the close box of the Mini vMacwindow, or with the quit command in the menu(Macintosh/Windows). </p><p> If a disk image is mounted, clicking in the close box orchoosing the quit command in the menu will bring up a warningdialog. Choosing Control-Q will display a warning, with theoption of typing &lsquo;Y&rsquo; to force quit. </p><p> It is also possible for software running within the emulationto cause Mini vMac to quit automatically. See&ldquo;<a href="extras/autoquit/index.html">AutoQuit</a>&rdquo;.</p><p> <a name="floppy_drives"> <b> Floppy Drives </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus has one internal floppy disk drive, thatcan use 3.5 inch 800K double sided disks or 400K single sideddisks. In addition, an external floppy drive can be attached.Mini vMac does not emulate the floppy drive hardware butinstead patches the ROM with a replacement disk driver,which can mount up to 6 &ldquo;disk image&rdquo; files. The informationon a floppy disk can be transferred to a disk image file.The preferred disk image format for Mini vMac is a filecontaining just the image data, with no header, trailer,or resource fork (and therefore without checksumsor tag data).Mini vMac will accept disk images in formats withtrailing information and no header, except thatit will pass an incorrect disk size to the emulated computer,which affects programs such as Disk First Aid. </p><p> Mini vMac also supports disk images in<a href="http://68kmla.org/wiki/DiskCopy_4.2_format_specification">&ldquo;Disk Copy 4.2&rdquo; format</a>,which has an 84 byte header, and usually contains checksumsand tag data. These images are mounted read only. The utility<a href="extras/cnvtdc42/index.html">CnvtDC42</a>converts Disk Copy 4.2 format images to a newimage without the tags and checksums and header,that Mini vMac can write to. Alternatively, Mini vMaccan be compiled with full read/write support for this format.</p><p> Compressed disk images are not supported. </p><p> Besides 400K or 800K, the replacement disk driver of MinivMac will also work with disk images of any other size lessthan 2G. It will pretend to have something more like a harddisk, though not exactly. This is not too authentic, but itis very useful. Mini vMac defines its own icon for thesedisks (with a &lsquo;v&rsquo;), which can be seen in the Finder on theemulated computer. </p><p> Bootable disk images should use the &ldquo;Hierarchal Filing System&rdquo;(HFS, now called HFS standard). The Macintosh Plus doesn&rsquo;tunderstand the newer &ldquo;HFS extended&rdquo;. The older &ldquo;MacintoshFiling System&rdquo; (MFS) will also work, but this mostly is usefulonly for communicating with the emulation of the Macintosh128K. Once the Macintosh Plus is booted, some Macintosh systemversions will support additional kinds of disks, such as DOS. </p><p> Mini vMac can boot with any system version that works on areal Macintosh Plus, that is, up to &ldquo;7.5.5&rdquo;. </p><p> There are many ways to &ldquo;mount&rdquo; a disk image in Mini vMac.(That is, to insert an emulated disk into an emulated floppydrive.) The icon of the disk image file can be dragged on tothe Mini vMac window (Then, if the Mini vMac window isn&rsquo;t infront, it will be automatically activated). In the Macintoshor Windows versions, the icon of the disk image file can bedragged on to the Mini vMac application icon (If Mini vMac isalready running, in the Macintosh version the disk image willbe opened in the existing process, while in theWindows version a new instance ofMini vMac will be launched). Also in the Macintosh or Windowsversions, choosing the &ldquo;Open Disk Image...&rdquo; command from the&ldquo;File&rdquo;<a href="control.html#menu_commands">menu</a>,or the &lsquo;O&rsquo; command from the<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>,will bring up the standard dialog to select a disk image file. Inthe X and Windows version, disk images can be specified in the <a href="control.html#command_line">command line</a>. </p><p> When Mini vMac is launched, it can automaticallymount disk images named &ldquo;disk1.dsk&rdquo;, &ldquo;disk2.dsk&rdquo;, up to &ldquo;disk6.dsk&rdquo;.Mini vMac will normally look for them in the folder containing the application.In the Mac OS X version, if the &ldquo;mnvm_dat&rdquo; folderexists it will look there, in the same way it looks for the<a href="hardware.html#rom">ROM</a> image.In the X version, if an argument of the form&ldquo;-d [directory_path]&rdquo; is used on the<a href="control.html#command_line">command line</a>,Mini vMac will look in [directory_path] instead. </p><p> In the Macintosh version, disk1.dsk and so onfiles may be aliases. In the Windows version, they may beshortcut files. Mini vMac stops at the first image notfound, i.e. if there is no &ldquo;disk2.dsk&rdquo;, it won&rsquo;t open &ldquo;disk3.dsk&rdquo;,even if it exists. </p><p> A disk image file may be locked. The emulated computer sees thisas a disk with the lock tab set. This allows you to use a diskimage and be certain the image file won&rsquo;t be modified. You canalso share a single locked image file among multiple runningcopies of the emulator. </p><p> Never mount an unlocked disk image simultaneously in two runningcopies of the emulator. And never mount a disk image in anemulator and at the same time mount it on the real computer.Such double mounting will usually corrupt the disk imageirreparably. Double mounting is not actually possible in Mac OS9 or in Windows. Very old versions of OS X would allowdouble mounting, but modern versions of OS X only allowone copy of Mini vMac to get write access to a disk image,and then allow other copies to get read access.The X versions use advisory locking to refuse to open for writing a diskimage that has been opened for writing by another copy of Mini vMac.</p><p> You can get a new blank disk image from the&ldquo;<a href="extras/blanks/index.html">Blanks</a>&rdquo;archive.To transfer files from your realcomputer into and out of disk image files, see the utilities<a href="extras/importfl/index.html">ImportFl</a> and<a href="extras/exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>.</p><p> The save operation of a program for the Macintosh Plus wouldnormally force changes to be written out to disk (and not justleft in RAM caches). When running in Mini vMac the changeswill be written to the disk image, but the changes to the diskimage may not be written out immediately to the real disk. Soif the real computer crashes or loses power, saved changes maybe lost. In the Macintosh and Windows versions, changes to adisk image are forced to be saved to the real disk when theimage is unmounted. </p><p> If you try to mount more than six disk images mounted at once,Mini vMac will display an error alert. This limit can beraised up to 32 disk images, with some memory and timeoverhead, by recompiling. </p><p> The floppy disk drives of the Macintosh Plus have a small holeinto which a straightened paper clip can be inserted, whichwill force the floppy disk to be ejected. Mini vMac doesn&rsquo;timplement this feature. You can always force Mini vMac to<a href="hardware.html#power_switch">quit</a>, or<a href="hardware.html#reset">reset</a>,either of which will unmount all disk image files. </p><p> All Mini vMac disk access is currently synchronous, so, forexample, mouse movement stops, and sound can be interrupted.This might be changed in some future version. </p><p> <a name="processor"> <b> Processor </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus has a Motorola MC68000 processor, runningat 7.8336 MHz. The emulated processor of Mini vMac canrun at approximately that speed (1x), but a number of othersettings are also available: 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x,32x, and All out. </p><p> The speed setting can be controlled by the&lsquo;S&rsquo; command of the<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>,that leads to another screen with more options.There is also a<a href="control.html#command_line">command line</a>option for the Windows and X versions to startMini vMac at 1x speed. </p><p> The maximum speed depends on the speed of the realcomputer on which it is running.Setting Mini vMac to run faster than this maximum isequivalent to setting it to &ldquo;All out&rdquo;. Otherwisethe percentage of CPU time taken by Mini vMac dependson the speed setting. On some computers the fans willstart running very loudly if a high percentage of theCPU time is in use. </p><p> So by default Mini vMac is set to runat 8x, instead of &ldquo;All out&rdquo;, so as not to stress currentmodern computers, but still feel reasonably snappy.Setting the speed to 1x makes some older games moreplayable, which weren&rsquo;t written with faster computersin mind, and would otherwise play much too fast. </p><p> Also a few programs may break in other ways at fasterthan 1x. When running faster, the emulated computerthinks time is running normally for each sixtiethof a second, but at the end of each sixtieth,a lot of instructions get executed instantaneously.This gives quite good, but not perfect, compatibility.The minimum emulation speed is 1x. If the real computerisn&rsquo;t fast enough to do 1x, the emulated computer willstill think it is running at the normal number ofinstructions per time, but its sense of time willnot match the real time. </p><p> The speed setting is only an approximation. Mini vMacestimates execution time using a table ofaverage number of cycles for each of the 65536 primary opcodes.Less or more accurate timing can be selected atcompile time. </p><p> Mini vMac will automatically shift down to 1x speedif there is no activity for a while. This is called the"AutoSlow" feature. It helps to preserve the batteryon portable computers. </p><p> If the user types, or clicks or moves the mouse, or the emulatedcomputer draws to the screen, or reads or writes to an emulated disk,that counts as activity that prevents AutoSlow.AutoSlow takes effect after either 0.5 seconds of emulated computertime, or 16 seconds worth of emulated instructions executed (usually about 2seconds at the default 8x speed), which ever is longer. </p><p> It is possible that some software will not draw anything to the screenfor longer than that while doing real work, so the AutoSlow featurecan be disabled with the &ldquo;autosloW toggle&rdquo;in the &lsquo;S&rsquo; command of the<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>.</p><p> Mini vMac finds the smallest rectangle enclosing the area of thescreen that has changed every sixtieth of a second. This makes Mini vMacmore efficient, since transfering images to the real screen tends to be expensive.If this rectangle is only a single pixel wide and less than 32 pixels tall,it is assumed to be only a blinkinginsertion point, that doesn't prevent AutoSlow. </p><p> By default, the emulation stops when the Mini vMac windowis not front most. But the &lsquo;S&rsquo; command of the<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>includes a &ldquo;run in Background toggle&rdquo;. So you can setsome computation going in Mini vMac and then use otherprograms on your computer. You can set Mini vMac to runin the background with the speed set to &ldquo;All out&rdquo;, butthis isn&rsquo;t recommended, except on a dual processorcomputer (Mini vMac can only use one processor). </p><p> The emulation can also be stopped even when the Mini vMacwindow is front most, by using the &ldquo;Stopped toggle&rdquo;in the &lsquo;S&rsquo; command of the<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>.This can be useful, for example, to pause a game. </p><p> When in <a href="hardware.html#screen">Full Screen Mode</a>,with speed set to &ldquo;All out&rdquo;,some versions of Mini vMac will try to prevent otherprograms from running as much as possible, for the smoothestpossible emulation. This is so far implemented in the Mac OS9 and Windows versions. </p><p> <a name="ram"> <b> RAM </b> </a> </p><p> A Macintosh Plus can have 1M, 2M, 2.5M, or 4M of &ldquo;RAM&rdquo;(Random Access Memory). Mini vMac normally emulates acomputer with 4M of RAM, but this can be changed to one ofthe other 3 values by recompiling. </p><p> <a name="screen"> <b> Screen </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus has a 512 by 342 pixel black and whitescreen, redrawn 60.15 times per second from one of two&ldquo;screen buffers&rdquo; in RAM. Mini vMac examines the currentscreen buffer 60.15 times per second, and compares it tothe previous contents. If something has changed, the currentbuffer is drawn to the real screen, minus any unchanged linesat the top and bottom. If emulation is lagging (below thespeed of a real Mac Plus), it will only redraw a part of thescreen each time. </p><p> When Mini vMac launches, it creates a 512 by 342 window todisplay the emulated screen. This window is given the same nameas the Application.(So if you rename the Mini vMac application, when youlaunch it the window will have that new name.)In the X version, if an argument of the form&ldquo;-n [app_name]&rdquo; is used on the<a href="control.html#command_line">command line</a>,Mini vMac will use that name instead. </p><p> There is an option to doublethe size of the display. This can be easier to read, sincemodern screens often have smaller pixels than in the originalMac Plus (about 1/74th inch). Magnify Mode can be toggledwith the &lsquo;M&rsquo; command of the<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>. </p><p> Some computer monitors have trouble displaying the 50 percentgray pattern commonly used on old Macintoshes.Magnify Mode helps to alleviate this problem. </p><p> Magnify Mode can have performance problems on somecomputers with some operating systems.While a modern computer has no troubleemulating the processor at ten times the speed of the originalif the screen doesn&rsquo;t need to be redrawn, drawing full screenvideo at 60.15 frames a second can be a problem. </p><p> Mini vMac has a Full Screen Mode, where the menus and otherprograms are hidden, leaving only the emulated screen.The Magnify option isturned on automatically if your screen has high enoughresolution (1024 pixels across or greater). Full Screen Modecan be toggled with the &lsquo;F&rsquo; command of the<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>. </p><p> If the emulated screen is larger than the real screenwhile in Full Screen Mode, the emulated screen will bescrolled to keep the mouse pointer in view. Thismay not work well if the software runningon the emulated computer hides the mouse pointer. </p><p> Toggling Full Screen Mode affects more than just thedisplay. The design idea is that when in the regular mode,Mini vMac should try to behave as much like a normalcooperative application as possible, while in Full Screenmode it will try to take over the entire computer as much aspossible. In Full Screen Mode, Mini vMac will tryto monopolize the <a href="hardware.html#processor">processor</a>,and grab the <a href="hardware.html#keyboard">keyboard</a>.Also, the <a href="hardware.html#mouse">mouse</a> is emulateddifferently in Full Screen Mode. </p><p> There is not supposed to be any way to leave Full Screenmode except for the &lsquo;F&rsquo; command of the control Mode.However, sometimes there is no way to prevent the operatingsystem from bringing up some other program. Mini vMac will detectif it is no longer the active application, and turn off FullScreen mode. </p><p> The X version has a<a href="control.html#command_line">command line</a>option, &ldquo;-display [display_name]&rdquo; or&ldquo;--display [display_name]&rdquo;. XOpenDisplay will be calledwith [display_name] as the argument. This apparentlyallows you to choose what screen the Mini vMac windowwill open onto, even onto a screen of another computer.This has never been tested. </p><p> <a name="keyboard"> <b> Keyboard </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus has an external keyboard with its ownprocessor. Mini vMac emulates the protocol used to talk tothis keyboard. This protocol deals with keys being pressedand released, so Mini vMac looks at the keys being pressedand released on the real computer, instead of the charactersthat the real computer would normally translate them into.So Mini vMac may not be affected if the real computer is setto use the Dvorak layout, for example. But you can make theoperating system running within Mini vMac use a Dvorak layoutif you want it.This low level keyboard emulation has the advantage that allthe Macintosh special characters can be typed in the Windowsand X versions, and that software such as the debuggersMacsBug and TMON will work. </p><p> The keyboard communication protocol will support keys notpresent on Macintosh Plus keyboard  (&ldquo;Page Down&rdquo; for example).So Mini vMac goes ahead and transmits the modern keys. Onemodern key not present on the Mac Plus is the &lsquo;control&rsquo; key.Mini vMac provides a way to press the control key of theemulated computer, even though the control key is being usedfor the <a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>.&ldquo;Control-K&rdquo; presses the emulated control key, and&ldquo;Control-K&rdquo; again releases it. </p><p> In the Windows or X versions, the &lsquo;alt&rsquo; keyis used for the emulated command key, and the &lsquo;windows&rsquo; key(or the &lsquo;application&rsquo; key) is used for theemulated option key. </p><p> In all versions, the F1 key can be used as the emulated optionkey and the F2 key can be used as the emulated command key.This provides a way to type somekey combinations that are intercepted by the OS ofthe real computer. For example, F2-Shift-3 will takea screen shot in the emulated computer, whereason a Macintosh, Command-Shift-3 takes a screen shot ofthe real computer at the same time. </p><p> When you switch away from Mini vMac, all emulated keysare released (except for the emulated caps lockand control keys). (You can not see the change thenunless &ldquo;run in Background&rdquo; is on.)When you switch back to Mini vMac, the emulated keysremain released, and the real keys held down atthat moment are ignored. </p><p> There is an exception to thiswhen you drag a file onto the Mini vMac window,so that Command-Option will work to rebuild the desktopof a disk image. However, the keys that map to command and optioncan have special meanings in other operating systems.(For example, in OS X, clicking on the window of another applicationwith command and option down will hide all other applications.)So it usually works better to press command-option right beforedropping, instead of before dragging. </p><p> When in <a href="hardware.html#screen">Full Screen Mode</a>, Mini vMacwill try to &ldquo;grab&rdquo; the keyboard, preventing the operatingsystem from intercepting keys. So in the Windows version,the &lsquo;windows&rsquo; key can be used as an &lsquo;option&rsquo; key, insteadof popping up the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; menu. And in theOS X version, Command-Tab won't switch away from Mini vMac.This is also implemented in the X version. </p><p> <a name="mouse"> <b> Mouse </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus mouse has a ball that turns two rollersas it moves, one for horizontal and one for vertical. Therollers are each connected to a disk with a series of smallholes. As the holes pass by a sensor, the Macintosh getsinterrupted. There is a second sensor to allow the Macintoshto tell which edge of the hole, and so which direction themouse is moving. The interrupt handler keeps count of howthe mouse is moved. Then 60.15 times a second, it sees howfar the mouse has moved and updates the cursor on thescreen. </p><p> Mini vMac does not emulate the mouse hardware. Instead, ithas two different behaviors depending on whether<a href="hardware.html#screen">Full Screen Mode</a> is on. </p><p> If not in Full Screen Mode, then 60.15 times a second MinivMac translates the coordinates of the mouse on the realcomputer to coordinates on the emulated screen, and directlypokes this location into low memory of the emulated computer.This not very authentic mouse emulation is convenient inthat you can easily move the mouse from the Mini vMacwindow, to click in the menu bar or to activate anotherprogram. But this emulation is not good enough for someprograms (such as Crystal Quest, HeartQuest, Slime Invaders,Arkenoid, MacLanding, Apache Strike, Stepping Out, andMicrosoft Flight Simulator), and for other programs (such asDark Castle) it is preferable to constrain the mouse to theemulated screen, so you don&rsquo;t deactivate Mini vMac byaccident. </p><p> When in Full Screen Mode, 60.15 times a second Mini vMacchecks how far the mouse has moved, and pokes this into lowmemory of the emulated computer in the same fashion as thereal mouse movement interrupt would do. I don&rsquo;t know of anyprogram for which this emulation isn&rsquo;t good enough, so thereare no plans for an even lower level emulation of the mousemovement interrupts. The emulated Macintosh Plus isinitialized to use &ldquo;very slow&rdquo; mouse movement, and thevelocity of the real computer&rsquo;s mouse is passed directly tothe emulated computer. So the mouse in the emulated computerbehaves like the mouse of the real computer. For a moreauthentic experience, you can set the real computer&rsquo;s mouse toslow, and then increase the speed of the emulated computer&rsquo;smouse. </p><p> The method used to get the velocity (not just absolutelocation) of the mouse of the real computer may not work onall computers. Mini vMac has code that attempts to detectwhen this doesn&rsquo;t work, and then switches to the absoluteposition mouse emulation. However this check fails to detectproblems when running the Windows version of Mini vMac withinMicrosoft Virtual PC with Pointer Integration turned on, andwhen running the Mac OS 9 version of Mini vMac in classicenvironment of OS X. </p><p> Because Mini vMac translates the real mouse coordinates tothe emulated screen, when in<a href="hardware.html#screen">Magnify Mode</a>the mouse moves half as fast. </p><p> The Macintosh Plus mouse has a single button. In the Windowsversion of Mini vMac, if either the left or right mousebuttons are pressed, the emulated mouse button is pressed.In the X version mouse buttons 1, 2, and 3 are equivalent. </p><p> <a name="sound"> <b> Sound </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus can play 8 bit sound at 22255 samples persecond from one of two &ldquo;sound buffers&rdquo; in RAM. It can alsotoggle sound output at multiples of 1.2766 microseconds togenerate square waves. The sound volume can be set to one ofeight levels. </p><p> Sound is so far implemented in the Macintosh, Windows,and Linux versions. (Emulating sound in Linux requires ALSA;it is not part of the standard X11 protocol. Mini vMac loadsALSA dynamically, and so will still run if ALSA is not installed.)The volume is initially set to maximum. Squarewave sounds are approximated, being forced to fit into thesame 22255 samples per second as other sounds. </p><p> Sound in the Windows version will only work on computers thatcan play sound at 22255 samples per second, rather than amore standard value like 22050. If this turns out to aserious problem, perhaps a future version of Mini vMac couldbe made to just play the sound at 22050 samples per second,on computers that don&rsquo;t support 22255, making all the pitchesoff. </p><p> If the sound from Mini vMac sounds choppy, you could tryto quit other programs running on the real computer. Andin Mac OS 9 and in Windows, turning on<a href="hardware.html#screen">Full Screen Mode</a> will makeMini vMac try to take more of the real computer&rsquo;s time.To emulate sound properly, Mini vMac needs to get timeeach and every sixtieth of a second.If Mini vMac gets interrupted now and then for afew sixtieths of a second, then the generated sound willhave gaps, and sound absolutely horrible.A program that simply plays music doesn&rsquo;t have thesame problem as Mini vMac, because it can generatethe sound well in advance of when it needs to be played.Mini vMac has to play the sound as soon as possible aftergenerating it, or the sound will lag behind the restof the action on the emulated computer. </p><p> <a name="vertical_retrace"> <b> Vertical Retrace </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus has something called the &ldquo;vertical retraceinterrupt&rdquo;, which occurs once per screen refresh, 60.15 timesper second. Each time it increments a low memory variablecalled Ticks. This provides the main way the Macintoshcontrols the speed of user interface elements, such as caretblink time, scrolling speed, and window open/close zoomingspeed. </p><p> Mini vMac tries to maintain the correct value of 60.15 timesper second, but it enforces a minimum number of instructionsexecuted per tick. If it notices that the emulation islagging, it will try to sacrifice the smoothness of video. </p><p> <a name="rtc"> <b> Real Time Clock </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus has a clock (the RTC, for &ldquo;Real TimeClock&rdquo;) that counts seconds since midnight January 1, 1904.This count is a four byte value, so it wraps around afterFebruary 6, 2040 6:28:15 AM. The RTC keeps this count evenwhen the computer is off, using battery power. The count isloaded from the RTC into low memory after the computer isturned on, and most of the time this copy is used and updated(by incrementing it every second) without referring to theRTC. </p><p> Mini vMac sets the emulated RTC from the real computer&rsquo;s clock60.15 times a second. This may not affect the count of secondskept in low memory, so the time displayed on the emulatedcomputer can become inaccurate if its once a second interruptis missed, such as if the emulation is paused. </p><p> One workaround for this problem is to have the Alarm Clockdesk accessory open. This apparently forces the count in lowmemory to be reloaded from the RTC. (I don&rsquo;t know why. Maybethis is a bug in the desk accessory rather than its intendedbehavior.) Another alternative is&ldquo;<a href="extras/clockfix/index.html">ClockFix</a>&rdquo;. </p><p> You can set the time of the emulated computer in Mini vMac,such as by using the control panel or the alarm clock deskaccessory. This doesn&rsquo;t change the time of the real computer;the emulated RTC is changed, which then keeps a constantoffset from the time of the real computer. </p><p> <a name="pram"> <b> Parameter RAM </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus stores various preference settings,such as sound volume, in &ldquo;Parameter RAM&rdquo;. This small areaof memory is preserved even when the power is off. </p><p> Mini vMac emulates the Parameter RAM, but it does notpreserve the contents. Every time Mini vMac launches, theParameter RAM is reset to default values. </p><p> These default values are not the same as the defaultvalues of a Macintosh Plus. The sound volumeis set to 7, instead of 3, if sound is emulated,otherwise it is set to 0. Mouse movement is setto very slow, so that mouse emulation scheme usedin Full Screen mode will work nicely, with the cursormoving at the same speed as it does on the realcomputer. AppleTalk is set to off, since thereis nobody to talk to.The Macintosh version will initialize the time zone,latitude, and longitude from the real computer&rsquo;s information.The Windows version only initializes the time zone.I have some code that can find the time zone for the Xversion, but I&rsquo;m not sure how portable it is,so it is disabled. </p><p> <a name="scsi"> <b> SCSI </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus has a SCSI (Small Computer StandardInterface) port for connecting to peripherals such ashard drives and scanners. </p><p> Mini vMac tries to correctly emulate the behavior of theSCSI port with no peripherals attached. </p><p> <a name="serial"> <b> Serial Ports </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus has two serial ports for connecting toperipherals such as modems and printers, and also forconnecting to an AppleTalk network. </p><p> Mini vMac tries to correctly emulate the behavior of theserial ports with no peripherals attached. </p><p> <a name="interrupt"> <b> Interrupt Button </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh Plus can optionally have installed a&ldquo;Programmers Switch&rdquo;, which has two buttons. The Interruptbutton will invoke any installed debugger. </p><p> The &lsquo;I&rsquo; command of the Mini vMac<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>presses the Interrupt button of the emulated computer.This action must be confirmed by typing &lsquo;Y&rsquo;. </p><p> <a name="reset"> <b> Reset Button </b> </a> </p><p> The optional &ldquo;Programmers Switch&rdquo; for the Macintosh Plusalso has a Reset button. </p><p> The &lsquo;R&rsquo; command of the Mini vMac<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>presses the Reset button of the emulated computer. If any diskimages are mounted, this action must be confirmed by typing &lsquo;Y&rsquo;.All unsaved changes are lost. </p><p> : </p><p> If you find Mini vMac useful, please consider<a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</A>.</p><a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html"><img src="https://www.gryphel.com/d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p> Next - <b><a href="extras/index.html">Extras for Mini vMac</a></b> </p><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/hardware- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2015 Paul C.
