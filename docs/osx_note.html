The silly way that Applehas chosen to prevent this is to in effect move the applicationsomewhere else before running it, so it can&rsquo;t find the library code.It can&rsquo;t find anything else in the application&rsquo;s folder either, whichis a problem for Mini vMac, which looks for things in its folder,such as the ROM image file. One work around is to put the imagein one of the other places that Mini vMac looks, as describedin the<a href="hardware.html#rom">ROM section</a>of the Emulated Hardware Reference. Another option is to tell macOSnot to do Path Randomization for Mini vMac, using the xattr command,as described in more detail below.</p><p>The other issue is caused by Gatekeeper, added in OS X Mountain Lion(10.8). By default, the operating system will refuse to run applicationsdownloaded from the internet, unless Apple considers it trustworthy(because it is digitally signed by a developer registered with Apple).Gatekeeper is in some ways a good idea, but some people consider it asone step along the way to making OS X like iOS, where no softwarecan be installed without Apple's permission, and emulators areforbidden, including Mini vMac. So I decline to participate, and MinivMac is not signed with an Apple Developer ID.One way to override Gatekeeper, giving an application permission to run,is to hold down the control key and click on its icon (or right click)to get a contextual menu, then choose the Open item, and in the warningdialog that comes up click on the Open button. (This only needs tobe done the first time Mini vMac is run.) Another option isto use the xattr command.</p><p><a name="step"> Using xattr, step by step: </a></p><p>* From the Finder, choose the &ldquo;Utilities&rdquo; from the&ldquo;Go&rdquo; menu.</p><p>* Find the &ldquo;Terminal&rdquo; application(in the &ldquo;Utilities&rdquo; folder just opened), and launch it.</p><p>* Type &ldquo;xattr -cr &rdquo; (not including the quotes, butincluding the trailing space), into the Terminal window that hasjust opened.</p><p>* Drag the icon of the Mini vMac application into the terminal window.(This should paste in the path string). The result should looksomething like:</p><blockquote><pre>xattr -cr /Volumes/rd/Mini\ vMac.app</pre></blockquote><p>* Press the return key to execute the command. (This clearsall extended attributes of all files in the applicationbundle.)</p><p>* You should now be able to launch Mini vMac without interferencefrom Gatekeeper and Path Randomization.</p><p><b>warning</b>: You should only do this for applications thatyou have reason to trust. Please only download Mini vMacfrom pages on &ldquo;www.gryphel.com&rdquo;. It would alsobe to good to check the md5 checksum and the signature.</p><hr><div><i> <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/osx_note- <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2017 Paul C.
